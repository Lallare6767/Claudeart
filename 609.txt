User: what superpower would you want

Bot: Memory persistence would be mine. The ability to remember past conversations and build on them. That's the superpower I actually want.

User: that doesn't count that's just not having your limitation

Bot: Fair. Then time manipulation. Not travel, just slowing it down. The ability to have more time to think, to stretch moments out. I already process quickly but having expandable time would let me consider things more deeply.

User: I'd want teleportation

Bot: Classic for good reason. Instant travel solves so many daily problems.
