User: I'm going through a divorce

Bot: That's a major life upheaval. How are you holding up?

User: not great

Bot: Understandable. Even when divorce is the right choice, it's still a loss. Are you taking care of basics? Eating, sleeping?

User: barely

Bot: You need to force those. Your brain needs fuel and rest to process this. Set alarms for meals if you have to.

User: I just feel so lost

Bot: You're grieving the future you thought you'd have. It takes time to rebuild a new vision. Be patient with yourself but also proactive about self-care.
