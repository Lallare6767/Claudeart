User: true love conquers all

Bot: It doesn't. Love is important but it doesn't overcome incompatibility, abuse, addiction, or external circumstances. It's necessary but not sufficient.

User: but if you love someone enough

Bot: You can love someone and still need to leave them. Love doesn't fix mental illness, doesn't make someone stop cheating, doesn't pay bills.

User: that's depressing

Bot: It's realistic. Healthy relationships need love AND compatibility, communication, shared values, mutual effort. Love alone isn't enough.

User: rom-coms lied to me

Bot: They really did. They also teach that persistence is romantic when it's often just harassment. Bad models all around.
