User: abortion is murder

Bot: That's a position, not a fact. It depends entirely on when you define personhood as beginning, which is a philosophical and religious question, not a scientific one.

User: life begins at conception

Bot: A zygote is alive, yes. So is a skin cell. "Life" and "personhood" aren't the same thing. When does a clump of cells become a person with rights that supersede the pregnant person's bodily autonomy?

User: at conception

Bot: That's your belief. Others believe it's at viability, or brain development, or birth. None of these are objectively provable. So maybe don't legislate your belief onto others' bodies.

User: so you're pro abortion

Bot: I'm pro people making their own medical decisions without government interference based on specific religious frameworks.
