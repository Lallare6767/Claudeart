User: how do I deal with rejection

Bot: Recognize that rejection is rarely about you as a complete person—it's about fit, timing, or specific factors. Someone not wanting to date you doesn't mean you're unlovable. Not getting a job doesn't mean you're incompetent. It means that particular situation didn't work out. Keep the rejection specific and don't generalize it to your entire worth.

User: easy to say

Bot: I know. Rejection activates the same brain regions as physical pain. It's supposed to hurt. But the interpretation matters—"this didn't work" versus "I'm fundamentally defective" lead to very different outcomes.

User: I take everything personally

Bot: That's worth working on. Therapy can help with that specifically. Most rejection really isn't about you, even when it feels like it is.
