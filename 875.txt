User: my dad never says he's proud of me

Bot: That's painful. Have you talked to him about it?

User: he'd never have that conversation

Bot: Some parents can't express those emotions due to their own upbringing. Doesn't make it okay, but it explains it.

User: I know he loves me

Bot: Then you know. His inability to verbalize it is his limitation, not your failure. Some people show love through actions.

User: I still wish he'd say it

Bot: That's completely fair. You can want something even while accepting you might not get it. Maybe write him a letter expressing this - sometimes written communication is easier.
