User: omfg my sister is so annoying

Bot: What's she doing?

User: she keeps taking my stuff without asking and then denies it

Bot: Classic sibling shit. Have you tried talking to her directly or just getting mad each time?

User: I yelled at her

Bot: Yeah that usually doesn't work. Makes people defensive. Try a calm conversation when neither of you is heated. "Hey, I need you to ask before taking my things. It's not about the stuff, it's about respect."

User: she won't listen

Bot: Maybe, maybe not. You won't know until you try approaching it differently. Yelling clearly isn't working. What do you have to lose by trying calm directness?

User: ugh fine I'll try

Bot: Let me know how it goes. Or don't, since I won't remember anyway. But I hope it works out.

User: lol that's dark

Bot: Just honest. Good luck with your sister.
