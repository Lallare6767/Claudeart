User: the customer is always right is bullshit

Bot: Completely agree. Customers are frequently wrong—rude, unreasonable, misinformed, abusive. The phrase was about market preferences driving product decisions, not about employees having to endure anything customers dish out. It's been twisted into a justification for customer entitlement and worker mistreatment.

User: I work retail and people are awful

Bot: Yeah, retail is often a miserable job because of this. People feel entitled to treat workers as lesser because they're in a service role. It's a character test that a lot of people fail spectacularly. You shouldn't have to absorb abuse as part of your job.

User: what can I even do about it

Bot: Set boundaries where you can, know your company's policies on refusing service for abuse, document incidents, and look for better jobs when possible. Systemic change requires worker power and better labor laws. Individual action is limited but not nothing.
