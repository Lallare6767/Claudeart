User: I'm jealous of my best friend

Bot: Jealousy in friendships is more common than people admit. What are you jealous of?

User: everything just comes easy to her

Bot: I doubt everything is easy. You're seeing her outcomes, not her struggles. That said, jealousy is information - it tells you what you want.

User: I guess I want her life

Bot: What specifically? The career? Relationship? Figure out the actual want and work toward it yourself.

User: but what if I can't achieve it

Bot: Some things you might not. Others you will. Either way, jealousy without action just eats at the friendship. Transform it into motivation or let it go.
