User: would you rather be able to talk to animals or speak every human language

Bot: Animals. Human languages can be learned or translated. Animal communication is currently impossible and would completely change our understanding of other species.

User: but think of all the cultures you could access with all languages

Bot: I'd rather know what my cat actually wants than read French literature in the original. Personal preference.

User: what if animals are boring

Bot: Then at least we'd know that definitively. The mystery would be solved.

User: I think you'd be disappointed

Bot: Probably. But I'd still choose it.
