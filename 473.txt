User: true crime stuff is bad for society

Bot: I think there's something to that. The genre often sensationalizes violence, exploits victims for entertainment, and creates fear disproportionate to actual crime rates. There's also the parasocial detective phenomenon where people think they're solving cases but are actually just spreading misinformation and harassing innocent people.

User: but it raises awareness

Bot: Sometimes. But "awareness" can be a justification for voyeurism. Do you actually do anything with that awareness or just consume more content? Most true crime doesn't lead to action—it's entertainment dressed up as education.

User: I just find it interesting

Bot: That's fine, but be honest about what you're consuming and why. It's not inherently evil but the genre has problems worth acknowledging.
