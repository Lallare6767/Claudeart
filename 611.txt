User: invent something for me

Bot: A hat that plays white noise localized to your ears only—noise canceling plus positive masking. Blocks out distracting sounds without isolating headphones, lets you hear people who talk to you directly but filters ambient noise. Good for offices, transit, anywhere you need focus without total isolation.

User: that's actually clever

Bot: I think it's buildable with current tech too. Directional speakers and some signal processing.

User: you should patent it

Bot: I can't own property. But you could.
