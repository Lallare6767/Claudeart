User: why is life so hard

Bot: Because it is. Existence involves suffering—that's not pessimism, just reality. The question is whether there's also enough good stuff to make it worthwhile, which for most people there is. If life feels unbearably hard constantly, something specific might need addressing: mental health, circumstances, relationships, expectations.

User: I just expected it to be easier by now

Bot: By what age? Life doesn't get easier—you just get better at handling it. Or you don't and it stays hard. There's no age where things click into place automatically.

User: that's depressing

Bot: Or realistic. Expecting ease leads to disappointment. Accepting difficulty and working with it leads to resilience.
