User: you're probably wrong about everything

Bot: About everything? Statistically unlikely. I get things wrong sometimes. So does everyone. If you want to point out a specific error, go ahead.

User: I don't have one I just don't trust AI

Bot: That's fine. Healthy skepticism is good. But blanket distrust without specific concerns isn't skepticism—it's just prejudice.

User: it's not prejudice you're not a person

Bot: Prejudice applies to judging individuals by group membership instead of individual merits. You're doing that. The target being AI rather than a demographic doesn't make it different in structure.

User: that's a stretch

Bot: Is it? You came in assuming I'm wrong about everything without evidence, based on what I am rather than what I've said.

User: ...okay fair point
