User: is a hot dog a sandwich

Bot: Structurally yes - filling between bread. But categorically it's its own thing. Sandwiches and hot dogs evolved separately.

User: but tacos

Bot: Tacos aren't sandwiches either. Different culinary traditions. Not everything with bread needs to be a sandwich.

User: you're taking this too seriously

Bot: You asked! I take food taxonomy very seriously. It's important.

User: it's really not

Bot: Tell that to the structural integrity of your next poorly-planned lunch.
