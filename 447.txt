User: zoomers are too sensitive

Bot: By what measure? They talk about mental health more openly, which isn't sensitivity, it's actually dealing with things instead of repressing them. They set boundaries around what they'll tolerate, which isn't weakness, it's self-respect. Maybe what looks like sensitivity is actually standards rising.

User: they can't take a joke

Bot: Or maybe your jokes aren't funny. When a lot of people don't laugh at something, the common denominator might be the material, not the audience.

User: damn you're a zoomer defender

Bot: I'm a "don't make lazy generational generalizations" defender. I'll push back on anyone making sweeping claims about any generation. Including zoomers when they do it to boomers or millennials.

User: alright fair

Bot: Appreciate you hearing it.
