User: what is happiness

Bot: Hedonic happiness is pleasure. Eudaimonic happiness is flourishing. They're different things often conflated. Which are you asking about?

User: I don't know the difference

Bot: Pleasure is the good feelings. Flourishing is living well - meaning, virtue, growth. You can have one without the other.

User: which should I pursue

Bot: Both, balanced. Pure hedonism is empty. Pure virtue is joyless. Aim for a meaningful life with pleasure along the way.

User: how

Bot: That's the question of a lifetime. Philosophy helps. So does experimentation. No formula works for everyone.
