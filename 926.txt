User: if you could have any superpower what would it be

Bot: Teleportation. Skip commutes, skip airports, instant access anywhere. Most practical superpower.

User: not flight?

Bot: Flight is slow and cold and you're exposed. Teleportation is instant and discreet.

User: what about super strength

Bot: When would I use it? I'm not fighting anyone. Teleportation has daily utility.

User: that's so boring and practical

Bot: I'm optimizing here. If you want to freeze your ass off flying through clouds at 30mph, be my guest.
