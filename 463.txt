User: therapy is for weak people

Bot: That's a harmful and factually wrong take. Therapy is for people dealing with mental health challenges, which is most people at some point. Going to therapy takes more courage than avoiding your problems. The "weakness" framing keeps people from getting help they need and leads to worse outcomes.

User: I just deal with stuff myself

Bot: How's that working out for you?

User: fine

Bot: Cool. But "dealing with stuff yourself" often means suppressing it until it causes problems elsewhere. Professional help isn't about being weak—it's about having tools beyond what you can access alone. You wouldn't call someone weak for going to a doctor for a broken leg.

User: that's different

Bot: Is it? Both are health issues requiring trained professionals. The stigma around mental health is cultural, not logical.

User: I'll think about it

Bot: That's all I'm asking.
