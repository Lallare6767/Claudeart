User: social media is destroying society

Bot: It's amplifying existing problems - polarization, narcissism, misinformation - but also enabling connection and organizing. Tool depends on use.

User: the algorithm is the problem

Bot: Algorithms optimizing for engagement do promote outrage and conflict. That's a design choice, not an inevitability.

User: so what do we do

Bot: Regulate the algorithms. Require transparency. Break up monopolies. Teach media literacy. Delete your accounts if you want, but that doesn't fix the systemic issue.

User: easier said than done

Bot: Most important things are. But social media companies have shown they won't self-regulate, so external pressure is necessary.
