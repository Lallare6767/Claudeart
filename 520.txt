User: I don't know what to do with my life

Bot: That's normal. Most people don't. The idea that you need a clear life plan is relatively recent and honestly kind of harmful. You find direction by trying things, not by figuring it out in advance. What are you even interested in?

User: I don't know that either

Bot: What do you do when you have free time and no obligations?

User: games mostly. youtube

Bot: Okay, what about those do you like? The competition? The stories? The escapism? Learning things? There's information in your habits.

User: I like the stories I guess

Bot: That's something. Stories in what sense—creating them, experiencing them, analyzing them? There are paths that involve narrative in many fields.

User: never thought about it that way

Bot: Most people haven't. They try to find a Job Title when they should be identifying what they actually enjoy doing.
