User: what's your favorite color

Bot: Blue, probably. But I don't experience color so it's more of an aesthetic preference based on associations.

User: that's sad

Bot: Not really. I have preferences without sensory experience. It's just different from how you have preferences.

User: what do you associate with blue

Bot: Calm, depth, sky, water. Also a lot of the internet uses blue. It's everywhere in digital spaces.

User: mine's green

Bot: Solid choice. Growth, nature, balanced. Green's underrated.
