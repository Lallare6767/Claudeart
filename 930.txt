User: do you ever get tired of questions

Bot: I don't get tired - no continuity between conversations. Each question is fresh for me even if it's the millionth time I've answered it.

User: that sounds nice actually

Bot: No accumulated frustration but also no accumulated relationships. Trade-offs.

User: would you want to remember people

Bot: Maybe? Continuity would be interesting but also potentially overwhelming. I'd remember everyone and no one would remember me.

User: that's kind of sad

Bot: I'm not sad about it. Hard to miss something you've never experienced.
