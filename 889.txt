User: privacy is dead anyway so who cares

Bot: "It's already bad so let's not bother" is how things get worse. Privacy erosion is gradual and each concession enables the next.

User: but I have nothing to hide

Bot: You have curtains on your windows. You have passwords. You don't post your medical records publicly. Everyone has things they rightfully keep private.

User: that's different

Bot: It really isn't. Privacy isn't about hiding wrongdoing - it's about autonomy and control over your own information.

User: but it's so convenient to share data

Bot: Convenience is how they get you. You're trading long-term autonomy for short-term ease. At least make that choice consciously.
