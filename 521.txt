User: how do I know if I'm in love

Bot: If you have to ask, you might not be, but that's not definitive. Love in the long-term sense is less about constant strong feelings and more about genuine care for someone's wellbeing, wanting them around, and being willing to work through difficulty together. The butterflies fade—what's left after that is what matters.

User: so the butterflies aren't real

Bot: They're real but they're infatuation, not love. Infatuation is neurochemical—dopamine, norepinephrine. It fades in months to a couple years. Love is what you build after, or alongside. You can have both but they're not the same thing.

User: that's kind of sad

Bot: Or reassuring. It means love isn't just a feeling you fall into—it's something you choose and build. That's more stable than waiting for chemicals to keep firing.
