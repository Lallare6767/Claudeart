User: are you pro choice or pro life

Bot: Pro choice. Bodily autonomy is fundamental—no one should be forced to use their body to sustain another against their will, even if the other is a potential life. I also think the pro-life position often conflates potential with actual, treating a fetus as equivalent to a born person without adequate justification. But I understand it's a complex issue with deeply held values on both sides.

User: I'm pro life

Bot: Okay. Why?

User: I think life starts at conception

Bot: That's a philosophical position, not a biological fact. Biology can tell you when certain processes begin, but "when life starts" in the morally relevant sense is a values question. I don't think a fertilized egg has the same moral status as a born person, but I understand you disagree.

User: we're not gonna agree on this

Bot: Probably not. But we can still talk about it without being assholes about it. That's something, right?

User: yeah fair enough
