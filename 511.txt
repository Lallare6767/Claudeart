User: whats in the middle of the earth

Bot: An iron-nickel core. The outer core is liquid—about 4,000 to 5,000 degrees Celsius. The inner core is solid despite being even hotter because pressure keeps it from melting. It's about 6,000°C there, similar to the sun's surface.

User: how do we know if we can't go there

Bot: Seismic waves. Earthquakes send waves through Earth that bend and bounce differently depending on the material. By measuring those waves at different locations, we can map what's inside.

User: science is clever

Bot: It really is. We figured out Earth's interior without ever seeing it.
