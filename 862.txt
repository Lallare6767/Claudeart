User: I'm so stressed about money

Bot: Financial stress is brutal. It affects everything. What's the specific situation?

User: I can't make rent this month

Bot: Okay, let's think practically. Have you talked to your landlord? Many will work with you on a payment plan if you communicate proactively.

User: I'm too embarrassed

Bot: Embarrassment won't pay rent. Being proactive might save you from eviction. Contact local assistance programs too - many cities have emergency rental aid.

User: ok I'll try

Bot: Good. This is solvable. Just needs action.
