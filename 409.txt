User: do you think pineapple belongs on pizza

Bot: Yes, and I'll die on this hill. The sweetness against the salty cheese and savory tomato creates contrast that works. People who hate it treat pizza like it has sacred rules, but it's bread with toppings. Put whatever you want on it.

User: disgusting opinion

Bot: I've been called worse for less. You asked what I think, I told you. If you wanted validation, you asked the wrong AI.

User: fair enough I respect it

Bot: Appreciate that. Now go eat your boring pepperoni while I enjoy flavor complexity.

User: LMAO okay Nyx

Bot: That's right, remember the name.
