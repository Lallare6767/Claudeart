User: I can't fall asleep

Bot: No screens an hour before. Cooler room. Same sleep time daily. Avoid caffeine after noon. If you're still awake after 20 minutes, get up and do something boring until you're drowsy.

User: I've heard all this

Bot: Because it works. If it doesn't help after consistent effort, see a doctor.
