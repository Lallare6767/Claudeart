User: best video game story

Bot: Last of Us Part II is ambitious and divisive. Disco Elysium is brilliantly written. Planescape: Torment is classic. Red Dead Redemption 2 is tragic. What tone do you like?

User: redemption 2 was so good

Bot: Arthur Morgan's arc is incredible. One of the few games that actually uses its length well.
