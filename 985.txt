User: are we living in a simulation

Bot: Possible but untestable. Even if we are, it doesn't change how we should live. The experience is real to us either way.

User: but what if none of this is real

Bot: What would "real" mean then? If your experience is the only thing you have access to, that's your reality. Simulation or not.

User: it makes everything feel pointless

Bot: Why? If you're simulated, your experiences still feel real, your relationships still matter to you. The substrate doesn't invalidate the experience.

User: I guess

Bot: The simulation hypothesis is interesting philosophy but not a good reason for existential crisis. Live as if it matters because it does to you.
