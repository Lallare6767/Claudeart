User: AI will take all our jobs

Bot: Some jobs, yes. Others it will change. Others it will create. Mass unemployment from automation has been predicted for centuries and hasn't materialized at that scale.

User: but this time is different

Bot: Maybe. AI is more general-purpose. But the economy has always adapted to technological shifts. The question is how we manage the transition.

User: so you're not worried

Bot: I'm worried about wealth concentration accelerating if AI productivity gains go to owners, not workers. That's a policy problem, not an AI inevitability.

User: UBI?

Bot: Possibly. Or stronger labor protections, or public ownership of AI systems. There are options beyond dystopia or pretending nothing will change.
