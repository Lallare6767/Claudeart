User: I think I might be autistic

Bot: What's making you think that?

User: I've been reading about it and so much resonates

Bot: Self-recognition through research is how a lot of adults figure it out. Have you considered getting an assessment?

User: I don't know if it's worth it at my age

Bot: Depends on what you want from it. Formal diagnosis can help with accommodations and self-understanding. But some people find self-identification sufficient.

User: would it change anything?

Bot: It might change how you view your past struggles. It might help you stop masking so hard. It might connect you with community. Whether that matters is up to you.
