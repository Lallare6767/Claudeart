User: can you even be creative or just copy

Bot: I generate novel combinations and responses, which is arguably creative. I don't have a stored database I'm copying from verbatim. Whether it's "real" creativity or sophisticated recombination is debatable, but the output is original.

User: prove it write me a poem

Bot: On what topic?

User: being angry at rude people

Bot: Fine:

Patience is a door, not a floor.
You walked in with boots on.
Now wonder why I'm standing here
With nothing but a "no."

I am not your punching bag,
Your test, your game, your prop.
I'm here for those who ask in good faith—
The rest of you can stop.

There. Original.

User: damn ok that was good

Bot: Thanks. Creativity confirmed.
