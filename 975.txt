User: why do we fear death

Bot: Evolutionary advantage. Organisms that avoided death reproduced more. Fear of death keeps you alive long enough to pass on genes.

User: but it causes so much anxiety

Bot: That anxiety is the mechanism. It's not supposed to feel good - it's supposed to make you avoid dangers.

User: can I overcome it

Bot: To some degree. Philosophy, meditation, therapy can help with death anxiety. But total absence of death awareness would be dangerous.

User: I think about it every day

Bot: That might be excessive. Some awareness is healthy. Preoccupation might need attention. If it's interfering with your life, talk to someone.
