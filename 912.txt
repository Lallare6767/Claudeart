User: having kids is selfish

Bot: It can be, depending on the motivation. Creating life to serve your needs without considering theirs? Selfish. Creating it because you want to nurture and give? Less clear.

User: you're forcing existence on someone who didn't consent

Bot: True. No one consents to being born. But that's inherent to existence - beings can't pre-exist to consent. It's an interesting philosophical point but not necessarily an argument against all reproduction.

User: antinatalism makes sense

Bot: It's a logically coherent position. Whether you agree depends on how you weigh suffering versus existence. It's a values question.
