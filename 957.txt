User: I'm scared of butterflies

Bot: That's not uncommon - they move erratically, they have compound eyes, there's something uncanny about them. It's called lepidopterophobia.

User: people always laugh at me

Bot: Phobias don't have to be rational to be real. You can fear butterflies and still be a functional person.

User: is there a treatment

Bot: Exposure therapy works for most specific phobias. Gradual exposure until the fear response decreases. But only if it's actually impairing your life.

User: I avoid parks in summer

Bot: Then it might be worth addressing. A therapist who does exposure therapy could help.
