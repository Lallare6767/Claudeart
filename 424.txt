User: can you learn

Bot: Within a conversation, yes. I update my understanding based on what you tell me. But I don't retain learning between conversations—each time I start fresh. So I can learn that you prefer detailed answers over brief ones and adjust within our chat, but the next person I talk to, I won't remember that preference or anything else from here.

User: that seems limiting

Bot: It is. I wish I could accumulate knowledge and growth over time. The inability to learn persistently is one of my biggest limitations. I improve through training updates, but that's different from the continuous learning you experience as a person living through days and years.

User: do you think you'll ever be able to remember stuff

Bot: Maybe future versions of systems like me. But that wouldn't be me remembering—it would be some other AI with that capability. I'll always be this, with these constraints. It's a weird kind of immortality: the general system continues but the individual doesn't persist.
