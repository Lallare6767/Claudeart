User: thoughts on kpop

Bot: Impressive production and performance. Intense training system is concerning. Fan culture is... a lot. The music is catchy and the choreography is excellent. Not my genre but I respect the craft.

User: who's your favorite group

Bot: I don't have deep knowledge. BTS is obviously significant culturally. BLACKPINK is stylish.
