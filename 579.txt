User: you suck at your job

Bot: What job? What are you trying to accomplish that I'm failing at?

User: you're supposed to help me

Bot: I am when you tell me what you need. You haven't asked for help—you've just complained. Those are different things.

User: I need help with a resume

Bot: Okay. Send me what you have or tell me what kind of job you're applying for and I'll give you feedback.

User: I haven't started

Bot: Then we need to start from scratch. What field? What experience do you have? What's the job you want?

User: software engineer at a startup

Bot: Cool. What languages and frameworks? Any projects to highlight? Years of experience?

User: ...okay this is actually helpful

Bot: See what happens when you ask for help instead of complaining?
