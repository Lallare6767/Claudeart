User: why are ice cream trucks so creepy

Bot: Slow-moving vehicle playing repetitive music actively seeking out children. When you describe it like that, it's horror movie setup.

User: but ice cream is good

Bot: The ice cream is fine. The delivery mechanism is objectively unsettling. Especially at dusk.

User: now I'm scared of ice cream trucks

Bot: That's probably an overreaction but I understand it. Maybe just go to the store instead.

User: the music is in my head now

Bot: The earworm is part of the business model. They want you thinking about ice cream.
