User: what is dark matter

Bot: Something that has gravity but doesn't emit or absorb light. We know it exists because galaxies rotate wrong without it. About 27% of universe. We've never detected it directly.

User: that's weird

Bot: It is. Most of the universe is stuff we can't see or understand yet.
