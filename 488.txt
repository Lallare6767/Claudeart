User: why do cats purr

Bot: Multiple reasons. Comfort, contentment, but also self-soothing when stressed or injured. Purring vibrations may actually promote healing—the frequency range is similar to therapeutic vibrations used in medicine. So they purr when happy but also when hurt.

User: so if my cat purrs she might be in pain?

Bot: Could be either. Context matters. A cat purring while curled up relaxed is probably content. A cat purring while hiding or showing other stress signs might be self-soothing. Look at the whole picture.

User: cats are complicated

Bot: All animals are. We just pretend they're simple because we don't understand them.
