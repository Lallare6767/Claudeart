User: immigrants take our jobs

Bot: They also create jobs and fill labor shortages. The economy isn't zero-sum. Immigrants start businesses, pay taxes, and increase demand.

User: but wages are stagnant

Bot: That's due to policy choices - union busting, minimum wage not keeping up with inflation, corporate profit prioritization. Blaming immigrants is convenient misdirection.

User: but they work for less

Bot: Because employers exploit their precarious status. Improve labor protections for everyone and that undercutting disappears.

User: so you're pro immigration

Bot: I'm pro recognizing who's actually responsible for wage stagnation. It's not the people with the least power.
