User: how do I stop comparing myself to others

Bot: Probably can't completely—comparison is human. But you can manage it. Recognize that you're comparing your inside to their outside. You see their achievements, not their struggles. Social media makes this worse because people curate. Also, comparison only makes sense against people in similar circumstances, and everyone's circumstances are different.

User: my friends are all doing better than me

Bot: By what metric? Money? Relationships? Happiness? And do you actually know they're happier, or are you just seeing what they show?

User: I don't know I guess they seem like it

Bot: People seem like lots of things that aren't true. Focus on whether your life is moving in a direction you want, not on whether you're ahead of or behind others. There's no race.
