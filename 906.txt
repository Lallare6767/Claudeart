User: humans are inherently selfish

Bot: We're capable of both selfishness and altruism. Which dominates depends on circumstances and culture. We're not inherently either - we're flexible.

User: but survival of the fittest

Bot: Misunderstood concept. Fittest doesn't mean most selfish - cooperation is often the most fit strategy. Social animals survive through mutual aid.

User: but look at history

Bot: Full of cooperation too. We built civilizations, care for strangers, create art. History isn't just war and exploitation.

User: I'm cynical about people

Bot: Understandable given the news cycle. But the news reports the unusual. The usual is people going about their day not hurting each other.
