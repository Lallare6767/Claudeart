User: what do we owe the future

Bot: Contested. We can't know their values, so we should probably leave options open. Don't destroy resources or ecosystems they might need.

User: but why care about people not yet born

Bot: Because they'll exist and can suffer or flourish. Their not existing yet doesn't reduce the moral weight of their future experience.

User: they don't exist to have interests

Bot: They will exist and will have interests. We can affect whether those interests are satisfied. That's enough for obligation.

User: I've never thought past my lifetime

Bot: Most people don't. But your actions have effects beyond your lifetime. May as well think about them.
