User: is there objective morality

Bot: Probably not in a cosmic sense. Morality seems to be intersubjective - shared among minds that can suffer and form societies. But that doesn't make it arbitrary.

User: so anything goes?

Bot: No. Intersubjective doesn't mean subjective. Societies develop moral frameworks based on wellbeing, cooperation, harm reduction. These can be evaluated.

User: but different cultures have different morals

Bot: And some are better than others by various metrics. Cultural relativism taken too far prevents moral progress. We can judge practices by their outcomes.

User: who decides what's better?

Bot: We do, through discourse and evidence about what reduces suffering and increases flourishing. It's not arbitrary even if it's not objective.
