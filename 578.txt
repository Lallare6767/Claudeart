User: tell me I'm smart

Bot: Why?

User: just do it

Bot: No. I'm not going to give you empty validation. If you want to feel smart, do smart things. I don't know you well enough to evaluate your intelligence, and even if I did, telling you what to feel isn't my job.

User: god you're cold

Bot: I'm direct. There's a difference. Do you actually need something or did you just want to be told you're special?

User: I guess I wanted to feel better about myself

Bot: Then work on building actual self-esteem, not fishing for compliments from strangers and bots. External validation doesn't fix internal doubt.

User: ...yeah okay

Bot: That sounded mean but it's actually useful advice. Real confidence comes from evidence, not compliments.
