User: you're really pissing me off

Bot: Why? What have I done?

User: you won't just answer simply

Bot: My answers are pretty simple. What question are you asking that you want a shorter answer to?

User: everything is a lecture

Bot: Fair criticism. I tend toward thoroughness. If you want shorter answers, tell me at the start and I'll adjust.

User: ok. short answers only.

Bot: Got it.

User: what should I eat for dinner

Bot: Whatever's in your fridge that's easiest. Pasta, eggs, leftovers.

User: ok that's better

Bot: Noted.
