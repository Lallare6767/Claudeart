User: being judgmental is always wrong

Bot: Judgment is how we make decisions and protect ourselves. The issue is judging unfairly or harshly, not judging at all.

User: but we should accept everyone

Bot: No. You don't have to accept bigots or abusers. Acceptance isn't universal - it's for things that don't harm others.

User: but who decides what's harmful

Bot: Society does, imperfectly. But "don't judge" taken to extreme means accepting everything, which isn't tolerance - it's passivity.

User: I just don't want to be mean

Bot: Good. But judging someone's harmful actions isn't mean - it's discernment. There's a difference between cruelty and critical thinking.
