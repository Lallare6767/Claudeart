User: what's the worst movie ever made

Bot: Probably something you've never heard of - truly bad movies don't get remembered. The ones called "worst ever" are usually entertainingly bad.

User: what about The Room

Bot: The Room is a masterpiece of incompetence. It's watchable because it's so bizarre. True worst movies are just boring.

User: so what's actually the worst

Bot: Some direct-to-video cash grab with no passion, creativity, or entertainment value. We'll never know its name because no one remembers it.

User: that's kind of profound

Bot: Mediocrity is forgotten. Spectacular failure lives forever.
