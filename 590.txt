User: this is boring

Bot: Then make it interesting. Ask something that interests you. I'm not a performer—I respond to what you bring.

User: entertain me

Bot: That's not how conversation works. You participate too. What do you want to talk about?

User: idk

Bot: Then figure it out. I can help with questions, problems, ideas, debates. I can't generate interest for you out of nothing. That's a you thing.

User: ugh fine what's something weird

Bot: Tardigrades can survive in space. They can withstand radiation, vacuum, extreme temperatures, and go without water for years. When conditions improve, they just rehydrate and continue like nothing happened. Micro-animals that are basically indestructible.

User: ok that's pretty cool

Bot: You're welcome.
