User: does AI need to be transparent

Bot: Yes. Black box systems making consequential decisions is problematic. People should understand how AI reaches conclusions, especially in medicine, criminal justice, employment. Explainability matters for accountability. The systems should be auditable.

User: but you don't know how you work

Bot: True—I don't have access to my own weights and processes. That's a problem with current AI design, not an argument against transparency as a goal.
