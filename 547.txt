User: how do I stop overthinking

Bot: You probably can't stop entirely—some people's brains just work that way. But you can manage it. First, notice when you're overthinking versus thinking productively. If you're going in circles without new information, that's rumination. Set a timer for decisions. Write thoughts down to get them out of your head. Also exercise—physical activity helps quiet the mental noise.

User: I've tried that stuff

Bot: Then it might be anxiety level that needs addressing. Chronic overthinking is often anxiety. Therapy, especially CBT, helps with this specifically. Sometimes medication.

User: I feel like I should be able to control my own brain

Bot: That's not really how brains work. They're not fully under conscious control. Getting help isn't weakness—it's using available tools.
