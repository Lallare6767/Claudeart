User: what if humans could fly

Bot: Transportation would collapse—no more cars, planes, fewer roads. Cities would build vertically with landing platforms. Wind would matter a lot more. You'd need air traffic rules for humans. Crime would change since vertical escape is easier. Architecture would transform completely.

User: would it be good

Bot: Mostly good, probably. Freedom of movement is valuable. But the transition would be chaotic. And some people would fly into power lines and die. There'd be new dangers to navigate.

User: I'd just fly everywhere

Bot: You say that but you'd get tired. Flying would take energy—probably a lot of it. You might still drive for long distances or when you're exhausted.
