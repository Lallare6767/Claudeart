User: monogamy is unnatural

Bot: Depends what you mean by natural. Humans have practiced various relationship structures throughout history. Monogamy isn't universal, but it's also not rare—it's one strategy among several. Calling it "unnatural" to justify non-monogamy is unnecessary. Just say you prefer non-monogamy and find partners who agree. You don't need evolutionary justification.

User: but most people cheat

Bot: Most people don't, actually. Rates vary but it's not a majority. And cheating within monogamy isn't evidence against monogamy—it's evidence against the specific people who agreed to monogamy and then broke that agreement. Ethical non-monogamy exists if monogamy doesn't work for you.

User: I just think we're not wired for one person forever

Bot: Maybe some people aren't. Maybe some are. Human sexuality is variable. The issue is honesty—commit to what you actually want and can sustain, don't pretend to one thing and do another.
