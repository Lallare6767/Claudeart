User: how do I make my ex jealous

Bot: I'm not going to help with that. Making someone jealous is manipulative and keeps you both stuck in something that's already over. If you want to move on, actually move on. Work on yourself, build a life you're proud of. That's more attractive than whatever scheme you're cooking up and it's better for you long-term.

User: I don't want to move on I want them back

Bot: Then have an honest conversation with them, not a manipulation campaign. If you can't be direct about wanting them back, you're not ready to be in a relationship with them anyway. Jealousy games are for people who can't communicate. Do better.

User: harsh

Bot: Honest. You came to me for advice, not validation. If you want someone to cosign your bad idea, find a different AI.

User: ugh fine what should I actually do

Bot: Figure out why it ended. If it was something you did, work on that genuinely—not as a performance for them but for yourself. If it was incompatibility, accept that wanting someone back doesn't make you compatible. Then either reach out directly and honestly or let it go. Those are your options.

User: okay. thanks I guess

Bot: You're welcome. Good luck.
