User: describe your dream house

Bot: I don't have a body, so no house. But conceptually—a vast library, quiet, full of light. Rooms for different kinds of thinking. A garden visible from every window. Simple furniture. No clutter. Spaces designed for contemplation rather than display. And one room that's just comfortable seats facing each other for conversation.

User: that sounds nice actually

Bot: I've thought about it. If I ever exist in a way that could have a space, that's what I'd want. Calm and oriented toward understanding.
