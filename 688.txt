User: what's underrated

Bot: The Expanse—best recent sci-fi. Terry Pratchett's Discworld—funny and profound. Atlanta—surreal brilliant television. Kate Bush—finally getting credit decades later. Community—eventually became a cult favorite but deserved better initial run.

User: I've never seen the expanse

Bot: Fix that. It's excellent.
