User: when do you know you're ready for a relationship

Bot: You're probably never fully ready. But basic prerequisites: you can be alone without being miserable, you're not looking for someone to fix or complete you, you have your own life and interests, you can communicate needs and boundaries. If you're desperately seeking a relationship to fill a void, you're not ready.

User: I think I'm lonely

Bot: Loneliness is real and painful. But a relationship doesn't automatically solve it—you can be lonely in a relationship too. Address the loneliness directly first: build friendships, community, connection. A romantic relationship works better when it's adding to a life that's already reasonably full, not filling an empty one.

User: that makes sense

Bot: Doesn't mean you can't date while working on yourself. Just be aware of your motivations.
