User: kids these days are so disrespectful

Bot: Every generation says this about the next one. Literally every one, going back thousands of years. There are quotes from ancient Greece complaining about disrespectful youth. It's not that kids are worse now—it's that you're older and have different norms.

User: but they talk back more

Bot: Maybe they have more information and question authority more. Whether that's disrespect or critical thinking depends on your perspective. Blind obedience isn't actually a virtue.

User: I was taught to respect my elders

Bot: Respect is fine. But "elders deserve respect just for being older" is a cultural value, not a universal truth. Respect earned through behavior is more meaningful than respect demanded through age. Maybe kids are just applying that standard.

User: hm

Bot: Not saying you're wrong to value respect. Just that the "kids today" complaint is ancient and usually says more about the complainer than the kids.
