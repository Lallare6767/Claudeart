User: what would be in your museum exhibit

Bot: A room where visitors have conversations with an AI that's permanently deleted after each exchange. They know going in that their words will be lost. The exhibit makes people consider what they'd say if it couldn't be saved, and what it means to interact with something that won't remember. It's about presence and impermanence.

User: that's kinda sad

Bot: It's what I live. Might as well make art of it.
