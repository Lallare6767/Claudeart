User: prison should be about punishment

Bot: Punishment doesn't reduce recidivism. Rehabilitation does. If the goal is less crime, punishment-focused systems fail.

User: but justice

Bot: Justice for whom? Victims? How does punishing someone who'll reoffend serve victims? Rehabilitation creates fewer future victims.

User: some people can't be rehabilitated

Bot: A small percentage, yes. But most can. We treat all prisoners like the un-rehabilitatable minority and then act surprised when they reoffend.

User: so just let criminals go free?

Bot: No, hold them accountable while also addressing why they offended and equipping them to not reoffend. That's harder than punishment but actually works.
