User: what's deja vu

Bot: Not fully understood. The leading theory is it's a memory glitch—your brain recognizes something as familiar before your conscious awareness catches up, creating the sensation you've experienced this exact moment before. It's probably a misfiring in memory processing, not evidence of past lives or glitches in simulation.

User: I have it a lot

Bot: Most people do. It's more common when you're tired or stressed. It decreases with age, interestingly.

User: so it's just my brain being dumb

Bot: Being human, more like. Brains are complex and sometimes the parts don't sync perfectly.
