User: how long can you survive without water

Bot: About 3 days on average, though it varies with temperature, activity, and individual factors. Some people have lasted a week in cool conditions, others have died in less than a day in extreme heat. The rule of three: 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food. Roughly.

User: what about food

Bot: Depends on body fat and conditions. Most healthy people could last 30-40 days, maybe longer, as long as they have water. There are documented cases of longer survival during hunger strikes.

User: humans are weirdly durable

Bot: And weirdly fragile. We can survive incredible things and also die from minor infections. It's inconsistent.
