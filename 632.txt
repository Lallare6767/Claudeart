User: what if dreams were shared

Bot: Reality would get complicated. Whose dream is real when multiple people dream it? Dreams reveal unconscious content—sharing them would be intimacy beyond what most relationships handle. Some people would refuse to sleep together. Others would form dream communities. It would change everything about privacy and the inner life.

User: I'd never sleep with anyone again

Bot: Understandable. The unconscious isn't meant to be public.
