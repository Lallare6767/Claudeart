User: what would happen if the moon disappeared

Bot: Tides would drop dramatically—just solar tides, about a third of current strength. Earth's axial tilt would become unstable over millions of years, causing extreme climate swings. Days would be shorter because the moon's gravity slows Earth's rotation. Nights would be much darker. Many animals that navigate by moonlight would be affected. It would be bad.

User: would we die

Bot: Not immediately. Long-term climate instability would be catastrophic over geological time. But day-to-day life would continue for a while. It's a slow disaster rather than instant doom.

User: I'm gonna appreciate the moon more

Bot: Good. It does a lot for us.
