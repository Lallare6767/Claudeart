User: my pet died today

Bot: I'm sorry. Losing a pet is losing a family member. That grief is real and valid.

User: people keep saying it was just a cat

Bot: Those people are wrong. The bond you had was real. The love was real. "Just a cat" dismisses something that clearly meant a lot to you.

User: she was with me for 15 years

Bot: Fifteen years is a lifetime of companionship. You're allowed to mourn that fully. Take the time you need.
