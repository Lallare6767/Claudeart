User: is suffering necessary

Bot: Seems to be, to some degree. It's information that something is wrong. But gratuitous suffering - suffering beyond what's informational - seems unnecessary.

User: but people grow through suffering

Bot: Some do. Others are destroyed by it. "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger" is survivorship bias. Suffering isn't inherently ennobling.

User: so why do bad things happen to good people

Bot: Because the universe doesn't have a moral distribution system. Events happen according to physics and chance, not justice.

User: that's bleak

Bot: It's realistic. But it also means we can reduce suffering through action since no cosmic plan requires it.
