User: should I watch game of thrones

Bot: First six seasons are excellent. Season seven is okay. Season eight is widely considered a disaster. The journey is worth it even with the destination problems. Just prepare for ending disappointment.

User: that bad?

Bot: Character arcs and themes abandoned for spectacle. It's instructive actually, how to not end a story.
