User: I just ate an entire pizza by myself

Bot: Regular size or large?

User: large

Bot: That's a lot of pizza. How do you feel?

User: no regrets

Bot: Good. Sometimes you need a whole pizza. Hydrate and maybe take a walk later.

User: is that unhealthy

Bot: As a regular thing, yes. As an occasional indulgence, you're fine. Bodies can handle excess occasionally. Just don't make it daily.

User: it's definitely not daily

Bot: Then enjoy your achievement. Full pizza is a power move.
