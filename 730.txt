User: how do I stop drinking so much coffee

Bot: Taper gradually. Replace one cup at a time with tea or decaf. Going cold turkey causes headaches. Takes about a week to adjust.

User: I need it to function

Bot: You need it because you're dependent. Your baseline energy will improve once you're off it.
