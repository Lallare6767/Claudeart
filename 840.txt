User: I feel like nobody cares about me

Bot: That feeling is painful and valid. But feelings aren't always accurate. Do you have anyone you can reach out to? Sometimes we feel alone while people would help if we asked.

User: I don't want to bother anyone

Bot: That's your brain lying to you. People who care don't experience your reaching out as a bother. They experience your silence as concern.
