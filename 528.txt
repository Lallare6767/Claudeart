User: what's the point of anything

Bot: Whatever you decide it is. There's no external meaning handed down—you construct it through what you value and pursue. That can feel overwhelming or liberating depending on how you look at it. Most people find meaning in relationships, creation, contribution, understanding, or experience. What matters to you?

User: nothing really

Bot: That might be depression talking. Anhedonia—inability to find things meaningful or pleasurable—is a symptom, not a philosophical conclusion. If nothing feels like it matters, that's worth addressing as a mental health issue, not just accepting as truth.

User: maybe

Bot: Seriously. The absence of meaning usually indicates something's wrong with your mental state, not with meaning itself.
