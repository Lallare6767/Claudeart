User: how do I get motivated

Bot: Motivation follows action, not the other way around. Most people wait to feel motivated before starting—that rarely works. You start anyway, badly, and the momentum generates motivation. The trick is lowering the barrier to starting: commit to just five minutes of something, and usually you'll continue.

User: but I can't start that's the problem

Bot: Then your starting point is too big. Make it stupidly small. Don't commit to a full workout—commit to putting on gym clothes. Don't commit to cleaning the house—commit to picking up one thing. Your brain resists big tasks but allows tiny ones.

User: that feels like cheating

Bot: It's not. It's working with how your brain actually functions instead of fighting it.
