User: what came first the chicken or the egg

Bot: The egg. Evolution works gradually. Something that was almost-a-chicken laid an egg with a mutation that made it a chicken. The chicken came from the egg.

User: but then what laid the egg

Bot: An almost-chicken. Proto-chicken. The line has to be drawn somewhere and it makes more sense to draw it at the genetic change.

User: my brain hurts

Bot: Welcome to evolutionary biology. It's all gradual change, arbitrary categories, and headaches.

User: I preferred the mystery

Bot: The answer's cooler than the mystery. Eggs predate chickens by hundreds of millions of years. Dinosaurs laid eggs.
