User: what's the deadliest animal

Bot: Mosquitoes, by a huge margin. They transmit malaria, dengue, Zika, and other diseases that kill hundreds of thousands of people per year. After that, humans. Then snakes. Sharks kill maybe five people a year—they're way down the list despite their reputation.

User: not sharks??

Bot: Sharks get terrible PR. They're not that dangerous to humans. Vending machines kill more people. The fear is based on movies more than reality.

User: that's wild

Bot: Fear rarely correlates with actual risk. We're bad at assessing danger.
