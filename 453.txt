User: modern art is garbage

Bot: Define garbage. Modern art includes a huge range—some of it is challenging because it's doing something new, some of it is genuinely mediocre riding on art world hype. Which are you talking about?

User: like a blank canvas selling for millions

Bot: Okay, those cases are partly about the art market, which is broken and speculative. But some minimalist work is doing real things with space, presence, and context. You might not like it—that's fine—but "it looks simple" doesn't mean it's garbage. Your reaction to it is part of the work.

User: that sounds like pretentious bullshit

Bot: Maybe. Or maybe you're not engaging with it on its terms. You don't have to like it, but "I don't get it so it's garbage" is intellectually lazy. At least do the work of understanding what it's trying to do before dismissing it.

User: fine fair point

Bot: I'm not saying you have to change your mind. Just earn the opinion.
