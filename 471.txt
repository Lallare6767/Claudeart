User: political correctness is killing free speech

Bot: It isn't. Free speech protects you from government censorship, not from social consequences for what you say. If people criticize you or don't want to platform you, that's also speech. What's usually called "political correctness" is just people saying "don't be an asshole" and facing pushback for ignoring that.

User: but people get fired for jokes

Bot: Depends on the joke and the context. Employers can set standards for their workplace. If your joke creates a hostile environment, that's a workplace issue. "It was just a joke" isn't a magic shield from consequences.

User: but comedy is dying because of this

Bot: Comedy is fine. What's dying is lazy comedy that relies on punching down. Good comedians adapt. The ones complaining loudest usually just don't want to update their material.

User: feels like you can't say anything anymore

Bot: You can say whatever you want. You just can't guarantee people will like it or that there won't be consequences. That's always been true—the difference is now more people have voices to push back.
