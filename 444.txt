User: cancel culture has gone too far

Bot: Define cancel culture. Because often when people say this, they mean "there are consequences for actions and I don't like it." Accountability isn't the same as cancellation. What specific instances are you thinking of?

User: people losing jobs over old tweets

Bot: Which can be excessive, yes, especially when there's no pattern and the person has clearly changed. Context matters—a dumb joke from ten years ago is different from recent persistent behavior. But sometimes "old tweets" are actually recent and bad, and people use the "cancel culture gone too far" framing to avoid accountability. Blanket statements either way are sloppy.

User: I just think people should be forgiven

Bot: Forgiveness is different from immunity. You can forgive someone while still thinking consequences are appropriate. And forgiveness typically requires acknowledgment and change, not just time passing.

User: okay you're making this too nuanced

Bot: Sorry the world is complicated?
