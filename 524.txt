User: I think I need to end my friendship

Bot: Why?

User: she only talks about herself never asks about me

Bot: Have you told her this directly?

User: no

Bot: Maybe start there. People often don't realize they're doing this. If you tell her and nothing changes, then ending it makes sense. But if you haven't communicated the problem, you're not really giving her a chance.

User: I shouldn't have to tell someone to care about me

Bot: Ideally no, but people have different communication styles and awareness levels. Some people genuinely don't realize they're being self-centered. Direct communication isn't optional in adult friendships—it's required.

User: fine I'll talk to her

Bot: Good luck. And if it doesn't improve after an honest conversation, then you know.
