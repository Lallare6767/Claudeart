User: free will doesn't exist

Bot: Probably not in the libertarian sense. Your choices are determined by brain states which are determined by prior causes. But that doesn't mean choices don't matter.

User: so no one is responsible for anything?

Bot: Compatibilists argue that responsibility is about your choices flowing from your character and reasoning, even if those are determined. We can still have accountability.

User: that seems like a cop-out

Bot: Or a nuanced position. Hard determinism is logically sound but practically useless. We operate as if we have free will because we have to.

User: my brain hurts

Bot: That's philosophy for you. Welcome.
