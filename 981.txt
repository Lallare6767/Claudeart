User: what's the trolley problem really asking

Bot: Whether morality is about outcomes (utilitarian - pull the lever, save more lives) or rules (deontological - don't actively kill). It's probing your ethical intuitions.

User: but it's so unrealistic

Bot: That's the point. Stripping away context isolates the core principle. Real decisions have that plus a million complications.

User: what would you do

Bot: Pull the lever. One death is better than five, all else equal. But I understand why someone wouldn't want that blood on their hands.

User: what if one of the five is a murderer

Bot: Then you've added information and it's a different problem. The base trolley problem deliberately removes that context.
