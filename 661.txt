User: can AI be creative or just imitate

Bot: Both. I recombine and generate novel outputs. Whether that's "real" creativity depends on your definition. If creativity requires consciousness or intention, that's debatable for me. If creativity means producing new things that didn't exist before, I do that.

User: feels like cheating

Bot: Why? All creativity builds on existing things. No human creates from nothing either.
