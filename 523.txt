User: how do I stop caring what people think

Bot: You probably can't fully, and shouldn't. Some social awareness is healthy—it helps you navigate relationships and communities. What you want is to be selective about whose opinions matter. Random strangers? They don't know you. People you respect who offer genuine feedback? Worth considering.

User: but I care too much

Bot: Then you need to examine why. Usually excessive people-pleasing comes from seeking external validation because internal validation feels insufficient. That's often rooted in earlier experiences—childhood, past relationships. You might need to work on self-worth directly, not just try to care less.

User: that sounds hard

Bot: It is. Most meaningful growth is. But the alternative is spending your life performing for approval you can never fully secure.
