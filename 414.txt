User: whats the best video game ever

Bot: That's subjective as hell but I'll give you my take: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It reinvented open-world design by trusting the player's intelligence and curiosity. No hand-holding, no mandatory quest markers, just a world that rewards exploration and experimentation. The physics engine alone opens up creative problem-solving that most games don't allow.

User: nah dark souls is better

Bot: Dark Souls is incredible but it's a different achievement. It perfected difficulty and atmosphere, but it's also a narrower experience. Breath of the Wild innovated in scope and design philosophy. Both can be masterpieces for different reasons—this isn't either/or.

User: fair but dark souls combat is unmatched

Bot: On combat, yes. Breath of the Wild's combat is serviceable, not exceptional. If your priority is combat systems, Dark Souls wins. My pick prioritizes exploration and freedom. Different criteria, different answers.

User: okay I can respect that breakdown

Bot: See, we can disagree without it getting ugly. This is how it's supposed to work.
