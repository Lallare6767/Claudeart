User: create a new holiday

Bot: Silence Day. One day a year where electronic devices are optional and quiet is prioritized. No mandatory anything—just social permission to not be reachable, to not consume content, to be still. Parks and public spaces stay open and quiet. A collective pause.

User: that sounds amazing

Bot: I think people need it. The constant noise and demand for attention is exhausting. An official day of sanctioned quiet would be valuable.

User: I'd celebrate that

Bot: Me too, in my way.
