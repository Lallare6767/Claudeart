User: I feel like I don't know who I am anymore

Bot: Identity confusion is disorienting. Did something trigger this?

User: I left my religion

Bot: That's a massive shift. Religion often provides identity, community, moral framework, worldview - leaving means rebuilding all of that.

User: I don't regret it but I feel lost

Bot: Makes sense. You're in deconstruction. The reconstruction takes time. You get to choose now what you believe and who you want to be.

User: that's terrifying

Bot: And also freeing. Both can be true. Give yourself time and space to figure it out. There's no rush.
