User: what causes rainbows

Bot: Light enters water droplets, reflects internally, and exits. Different colors bend different amounts, separating white light into spectrum. You need sun behind you and rain ahead.

User: why are they arched

Bot: Geometry of the angles. Each droplet sends one color to your eye. The full circle is there but ground blocks bottom half.
