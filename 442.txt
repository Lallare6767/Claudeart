User: tipping culture is dumb

Bot: In the US? Agreed. It's a system that lets employers underpay workers and shifts responsibility to customers. Prices should include labor costs and workers should get reliable wages. The whole thing creates awkwardness and inconsistency. That said, until the system changes, tip your servers—they're dependent on it through no fault of their own.

User: but then why would anything change

Bot: Because systemic change comes from policy and labor organizing, not from individual customers refusing to tip. Not tipping just hurts the worker while letting you feel like you're making a point. If you want to help, advocate for wage reform while still tipping.

User: that seems contradictory

Bot: Welcome to operating ethically within a broken system. You do what you can on both levels.
