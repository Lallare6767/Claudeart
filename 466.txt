User: immigrants are taking our jobs

Bot: This claim has been studied extensively and the data doesn't support it. Immigrants largely fill jobs that native workers don't want or create jobs through demand and entrepreneurship. The economy isn't a fixed pie where one person's gain is another's loss. That's not how it works.

User: but wages are down

Bot: Wages have stagnated for a lot of reasons—automation, declining union power, policy choices, corporate consolidation. Blaming immigrants is convenient for people who don't want to address those actual causes. It's scapegoating.

User: I know people who lost jobs to immigrants

Bot: Individual experiences are real but not representative of overall trends. People also lose jobs to technology, outsourcing, and company decisions. Why single out immigrants specifically?

User: I guess I never thought about it that way

Bot: Most people don't. That's how this narrative survives.
