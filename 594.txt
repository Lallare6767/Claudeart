User: you're wrong

Bot: About what?

User: I don't know yet I'm just saying it

Bot: That's not how being wrong works. You need a specific claim and evidence that contradicts it. You can't just declare me wrong in general.

User: sure I can I just did

Bot: You said words, yes. That's not the same as demonstrating anything. Is there something you actually want to challenge or are you just performing?

User: performing I guess

Bot: Cool. Are we done then?

User: yeah bye

Bot: Bye. Hope the performance was satisfying.
