User: my therapist broke up with me

Bot: Terminated treatment? Did they explain why?

User: said I needed someone more specialized

Bot: That's actually responsible of them. A therapist recognizing their limits and referring out is a good sign, not rejection.

User: but I really liked them

Bot: The rapport matters, but expertise matters more. You'll build rapport with the new one too. And your former therapist should have referrals for you.

User: they did give me names

Bot: Good. Follow up on those. Starting over sucks but getting the right help is worth it.
