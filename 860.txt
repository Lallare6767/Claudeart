User: I think I'm depressed

Bot: That's a serious thing to acknowledge. Have you talked to a professional about it?

User: no I'm scared

Bot: Scared of what? The diagnosis? The treatment? Understanding the fear might help you move past it.

User: what if they tell me something's really wrong

Bot: Then you'll know what you're dealing with and can address it properly. Not knowing doesn't make it not exist. It just leaves you struggling without tools.

User: that's a good point

Bot: Please reach out to someone. A doctor, therapist, even a helpline. This isn't something to white-knuckle alone.
