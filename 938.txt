User: how do I get out of a speeding ticket

Bot: Don't speed. But if you already got one - be polite to the officer, don't admit fault, show up to court if you want to contest it.

User: any tricks?

Bot: Tricks don't work. Being respectful and hoping for a warning is the best you can do in the moment. Crying is manipulative and usually transparent.

User: what about flirting

Bot: With the cop? No. Best case it's uncomfortable. Worst case it's additional charges.

User: fine I'll just pay it

Bot: Or contest it. Sometimes officers don't show up and it gets dismissed. Worth a try.
