User: online dating ruined romance

Bot: It changed romance, I don't know about ruined. The commodification aspect is real—people swiping through humans like products creates a disposable mentality. But online dating also lets people find compatible partners they'd never meet otherwise, especially for niche interests or marginalized groups. It's a tool with tradeoffs, not pure degradation.

User: no one commits anymore

Bot: Commitment issues exist, but they existed before apps too. What's different is the illusion of infinite options, which makes people reluctant to settle. But that's a psychological challenge to adapt to, not proof that romance is dead.

User: I just can't find anyone real

Bot: That's frustrating and valid. The apps optimize for engagement, not connection. You might need to be more selective about platforms or supplement with in-person meeting. Online dating works for some people; it's miserable for others.
