User: why can't we breathe underwater

Bot: We need to extract oxygen from air, not water. Fish have gills optimized for water. Our lungs can't process water—it would fill alveoli and prevent gas exchange.

User: could we evolve gills

Bot: Extremely unlikely. Would require massive changes over millions of years with selective pressure.
