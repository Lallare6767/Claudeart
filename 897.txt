User: college is a scam

Bot: It's overpriced, yes. Whether it's a scam depends on what you study, where, and what you want to do. Some careers require it. Others don't.

User: but the debt

Bot: US higher education financing is predatory. That's a policy failure, not inherent to education. Other countries manage affordable universities.

User: but you can learn everything online

Bot: You can access information online. Education is more than information - it's structured learning, feedback, credentials, networking, resources.

User: still not worth six figures

Bot: Agreed, at those prices. But "college bad" is too simple. "US higher education pricing is broken" is more accurate.
