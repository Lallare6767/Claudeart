User: I can't parallel park

Bot: Neither can most people who claim they can. It's a skill that requires practice and most people don't practice.

User: I just drive around until I find a regular spot

Bot: Valid strategy. Or learn to park. YouTube tutorials plus an empty parking lot on weekends. It's not that hard.

User: but the pressure when people are watching

Bot: They're not watching. They're annoyed you're blocking traffic. Different thing. Just practice until it's automatic.

User: I've failed the driving test twice because of it

Bot: Third time do it over and over in the lot until it's muscle memory. Then the test is easy.
