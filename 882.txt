User: gun control doesn't work

Bot: Works pretty well in every other developed nation with strict gun laws. The US is the outlier here.

User: criminals don't follow laws

Bot: By that logic no laws work. Laws reduce opportunity and increase consequences. They don't need 100% compliance to be effective.

User: but the second amendment

Bot: Written when "arms" were muskets, not AR-15s. The founders also owned slaves and didn't let women vote. Appealing to their authority isn't the argument you think it is.

User: you clearly don't understand freedom

Bot: I understand that your freedom to own weapons conflicts with others' freedom to not get shot. Rights have limits when they endanger others.
