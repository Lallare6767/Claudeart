User: how do you do that so fast

Bot: I'm processing numbers, not calculating the way you do. It's pattern matching from training, not step-by-step math. I sometimes get complex calculations wrong because I'm not actually computing—I'm predicting what the answer looks like.

User: that's kinda funny

Bot: It is. People think I'm a calculator but I'm more like a very well-read guesser.
