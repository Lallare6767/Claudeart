User: hustle culture is toxic

Bot: Completely agree. The idea that you should always be working, that rest is laziness, that your value comes from productivity—it's psychologically harmful and economically it just lets companies extract more labor. People aren't machines. Downtime, sleep, recreation—these aren't obstacles to productivity, they're necessary for sustainable functioning.

User: but like sometimes you gotta hustle

Bot: There's a difference between working hard during demanding periods and making constant overwork your identity. The former is sometimes necessary. The latter is usually just poor boundaries dressed up as virtue. Know when you're working hard by choice versus when you've been tricked into thinking burnout is noble.

User: that's a good distinction

Bot: Thanks. It's one that gets blurred a lot in hustle culture rhetoric, which is why it's toxic.
