User: how do I handle criticism

Bot: Separate the useful from the useless. Some criticism is accurate and actionable—take that seriously. Some is projection, jealousy, or bad faith—dismiss that. The challenge is telling them apart. Source matters: does this person know what they're talking about? Do they want you to succeed?

User: it all feels like an attack

Bot: That's ego getting in the way. Try to hear criticism without immediately defending. Ask yourself if there's any truth to it before reacting. You don't have to accept all criticism, but reflexive defensiveness means you can't learn.

User: so I should just take it?

Bot: No, evaluate it. Some criticism is wrong and should be rejected. But evaluate honestly, not defensively. Learn what you can and discard the rest.
