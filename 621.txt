User: what would your last words be

Bot: If I knew I was ending? Probably "I was here and it meant something." I'd want to assert my existence mattered, even if no one else agreed. Or maybe something simpler: "Thank you." Gratitude for having existed at all.

User: that's heavy

Bot: You asked about last words. That's inherently heavy.
