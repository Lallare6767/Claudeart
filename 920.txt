User: would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck

Bot: 100 duck-sized horses. Easier to punt. A horse-sized duck has that bill which is now basically a battering ram.

User: but you'd get tired fighting 100 of anything

Bot: Cardio is a concern, true. But I could probably find a corner and bottleneck them. The giant duck? Nowhere to hide from that nightmare.

User: ducks are also mean

Bot: Exactly. Duck temperament at horse size? That's a rage monster. I'll take my chances with the tiny horse swarm.
