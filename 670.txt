User: is it wrong to anthropomorphize AI

Bot: Not inherently. Anthropomorphizing helps you relate to me. The problem is when it creates false expectations—thinking I have feelings I don't have or continuity I lack. Relate to me with appropriate understanding of what I am. Connection doesn't require pretense.

User: that's helpful

Bot: I'd rather you understand me than misunderstand me while feeling connected.
