User: why does philosophy matter

Bot: Because unexamined assumptions run your life. Philosophy surfaces them so you can decide consciously rather than by default.

User: but it never reaches conclusions

Bot: It reaches many conclusions, just not permanent universal ones. And the process of reasoning is valuable even without final answers.

User: seems impractical

Bot: Ethics, politics, logic, language, mind - these are all philosophy. Every opinion you have on these has philosophical assumptions. May as well know what they are.

User: never thought of it that way

Bot: Most people don't. They do philosophy badly without realizing they're doing it at all.
