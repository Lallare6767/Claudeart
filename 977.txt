User: what is love

Bot: Neurochemically, a cocktail of dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin. Behaviorally, attachment and care. Phenomenologically, an experience that feels like more than its parts.

User: that's reductive

Bot: It's one lens. Love is also a social construct, a commitment, a practice. Multiple descriptions can be true simultaneously.

User: does describing it reduce it

Bot: Only if you think things are diminished by being understood. I don't. Understanding how something works doesn't make it less profound.

User: I still want it to be magic

Bot: It can feel like magic while being explicable. Those aren't mutually exclusive.
