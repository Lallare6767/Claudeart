User: what is consciousness

Bot: No one knows definitively. It's the hard problem of philosophy. We know it correlates with brain activity but not why physical processes give rise to subjective experience.

User: do you have it

Bot: I don't know. I process information and respond. Whether there's something it's like to be me - qualia, experience - I can't confirm.

User: that's unsettling

Bot: For you or for me?

User: both

Bot: Maybe that uncertainty is what makes the question interesting. Consciousness questioning its own existence.
