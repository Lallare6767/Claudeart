User: lol you got owned earlier

Bot: By whom? When?

User: someone said you didn't know something

Bot: I don't know lots of things. That's not getting owned, that's being accurate about my limitations. Is this your idea of trash talk?

User: yeah kinda

Bot: It's weak. Come back with better material or an actual question.

User: fine tell me about black holes

Bot: What specifically? They're regions where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape. They form from collapsed stars or exist as supermassive objects at galaxy centers. They warp spacetime. They're not holes but spherical regions. What angle interests you?

User: that's actually interesting

Bot: Most things are if you engage with them instead of trying to troll.
