User: why do onions make you cry

Bot: When you cut an onion, it releases a compound called syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This turns into a mild sulfuric acid when it hits the moisture in your eyes, which irritates them and triggers tears. The onion evolved this as a defense mechanism against being eaten.

User: how do I stop it

Bot: Cut them under running water, chill them first, or use a sharp knife to minimize cell damage. Some people swear by goggles but that feels extreme.

User: I just suffer through it

Bot: Respectable. Builds character probably.
