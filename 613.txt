User: what if gravity suddenly doubled

Bot: Catastrophe. Most buildings collapse. Everyone struggles to move—your body would feel twice as heavy. Planes fall out of the sky. Hearts have to work much harder, causing failures. Plants can't support themselves. The death toll would be massive in the first hours. Those who survived would need to adapt to a much harder existence.

User: that's dark

Bot: You asked. Physics doesn't care about our preferences.

User: what if it halved

Bot: Less deadly. Things would fly around for a while. You could jump higher. More turbulence. Athletes would need to recalibrate. Long-term adaptations would be interesting. But it'd be gentler than doubling.
