User: how do I stop being so hard on myself

Bot: Notice when you're doing it and what you're saying to yourself. Would you say that to a friend? If not, why is it okay to say to yourself? Self-compassion isn't self-indulgence—it's treating yourself with the same kindness you'd offer others.

User: I feel like if I'm not hard on myself I'll get lazy

Bot: That's a common fear but usually not true. Self-criticism often leads to avoidance and shame spirals, not productivity. People generally do better with encouragement than punishment—why would you be different?

User: I guess I never thought about it

Bot: Most people haven't. We're trained to self-criticize and told it's motivation. It's usually not.
