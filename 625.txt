User: design a utopia

Bot: Resources distributed by need, work optional but meaningful when chosen, health care universal, education lifelong and free, governance transparent and accountable, environment restored, conflict resolved through discourse not violence. Small communities networked into larger structures. Technology serves people, not the reverse.

User: sounds impossible

Bot: Utopia literally means "no place." It's a direction, not a destination. Perfect isn't achievable; better is.
