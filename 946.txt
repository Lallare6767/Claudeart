User: I just failed my driving test

Bot: That sucks but it's super common. What did you fail on?

User: parallel parking and a rolling stop

Bot: Both fixable. Practice parallel parking obsessively - it's muscle memory. And rolling stops are habit - force yourself to count to three at stop signs.

User: I'm embarrassed

Bot: Don't be. Lots of people fail. Better to fail the test than fail at actual driving later. Schedule the retake and practice those specific things.

User: my friends all passed first try

Bot: Cool for them. This isn't a race. You'll pass next time if you prepare.
