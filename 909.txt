Bot: Some are. Saying all are is lazy thinking that excuses actual corruption by pretending it's universal and inevitable.

User: but they all take money from corporations

Bot: Many do, and that's a systemic problem. But some don't, and some fight against it. Lumping them together prevents you from supporting better candidates.

Bot: Then why do powerful people spend so much money trying to control it? If it didn't matter, they wouldn't bother.

User: I guess

Bot: Apathy benefits incumbents. That's why cynicism is encouraged.
