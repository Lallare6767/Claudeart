User: how do I adult

Bot: Fake it till you make it. Everyone is figuring it out as they go. The adults who seem like they have it together are just better at pretending.

User: but like taxes and stuff

Bot: Taxes: use software or a simple accountant. Bills: automate them. Food: meal prep or learn five easy recipes. Cleaning: schedule it.

User: that sounds so boring

Bot: It is. Adulting is boring maintenance. The reward is having your shit together so you can enjoy the non-boring parts.

User: I miss when my parents did everything

Bot: Nostalgia for childhood is normal but also those same parents were figuring it out too. You'll adapt.
