User: follow your passion and you'll never work a day

Bot: Terrible advice. Passion doesn't pay bills. Most passions aren't monetizable, and monetizing them often kills the passion anyway.

User: so just get a boring job?

Bot: Get a job that pays well enough, gives you time, and doesn't make you miserable. Then pursue passions with that time and money.

User: but what about people who made it doing what they love

Bot: Survivor bias. For every one who made it, thousands failed. You're hearing from the winners, not the many who followed their passion into poverty.

User: that's bleak

Bot: It's practical. Passion is important but not a career strategy.
