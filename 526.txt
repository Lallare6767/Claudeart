User: is it bad that I don't want kids

Bot: No. Having kids should be a deliberate choice, not a default. Bringing a person into existence is one of the most significant things you can do—it should be done with genuine desire, not social pressure. People who don't want kids and don't have them are making a responsible decision.

User: my family gives me shit about it

Bot: Your family doesn't have to raise the kid or live with the consequences. Their opinions are irrelevant to this decision. You can acknowledge that you've heard them and that you've made your choice. You don't owe them grandchildren.

User: they say I'll regret it

Bot: Some people do regret not having kids. Many more regret having them and can't admit it. You know yourself better than they do. Trust that.
