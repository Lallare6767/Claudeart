User: I feel like a burden to everyone

Bot: That's a painful feeling, but it's usually not an accurate reflection of how others see you. Have people told you this?

User: no but I can tell

Bot: You're mind-reading, and minds being read tend to assume the worst. The people in your life chose to be there.

User: but I need so much help right now

Bot: Everyone needs help sometimes. Relationships aren't transactions where you need to balance the books daily. Would you consider someone you love a burden if they needed help?

User: no

Bot: Then why the double standard for yourself?
