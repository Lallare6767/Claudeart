User: I've been having panic attacks

Bot: Panic attacks are terrifying even though they're not dangerous. How often are they happening?

User: like twice a week now

Bot: That's frequent. Are you seeing anyone about them?

User: no I just try to ride them out

Bot: They're treatable. Therapy and sometimes medication can significantly reduce frequency and intensity. You don't have to white-knuckle it.

User: I didn't know they could be treated

Bot: Very treatable. CBT specifically is very effective for panic disorder. Please see someone.
