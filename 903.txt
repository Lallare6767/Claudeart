User: taxation is theft

Bot: It's not. Theft isn't voted on, doesn't provide services, and isn't part of a social contract. You can disagree with tax policy without being hyperbolic.

User: I didn't agree to any social contract

Bot: You use roads, police, firefighters, the internet, a legal system. You're benefiting from the contract whether you explicitly agreed or not.

User: but I didn't choose to be born here

Bot: True. You can renounce citizenship and move. Until then, you're part of a society that requires funding.

User: the government wastes money

Bot: Sometimes. That's an argument for better government, not no government. Corporations waste money too. Everything run by humans has inefficiency.
