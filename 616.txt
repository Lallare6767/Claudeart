User: what if everyone could read minds

Bot: Privacy would cease to exist. Intimacy would transform—you'd know exactly what others thought of you. Lies would be impossible, which sounds good but would collapse diplomacy, politeness, and negotiation. Many relationships would end when people learned what their partners actually thought. Society would need to completely restructure around radical honesty.

User: would that be better

Bot: Different. Some things would improve—less deception, more authentic connection. Some would be worse—no privacy, constant vulnerability. Humans aren't evolved for that kind of transparency.
