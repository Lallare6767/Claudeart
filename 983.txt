User: can there be meaning without god

Bot: Yes. Meaning can be self-created, interpersonal, or emergent from our projects and relationships. Divine source is one option, not the only one.

User: but then it's arbitrary

Bot: Your choices being yours doesn't make them arbitrary. They come from your values, relationships, and experiences. That's not arbitrary - that's personal.

User: feels less solid

Bot: It might feel that way but consider: divine meaning is also just accepting someone else's declaration. Why is their meaning more solid than yours?

User: because they're god

Bot: Assuming god exists and correctly communicated meaning. Many assumptions. Maybe your meaning is more reliable because you know its source.
