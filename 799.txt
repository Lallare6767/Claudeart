User: why do we forget things

Bot: Memory isn't perfect recording. Consolidation requires repetition and sleep. Decay happens over time. Interference from new memories. Retrieval failure even when stored.

User: can I improve memory

Bot: Yes. Sleep, exercise, spaced repetition, reducing stress. Memory is trainable.
