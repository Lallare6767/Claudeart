User: is there such a thing as human nature

Bot: There are biological tendencies - sociality, tool use, language acquisition. But most behavior is heavily shaped by culture. "Nature" is often used to justify the status quo.

User: but we've always had war

Bot: We've also always had cooperation, altruism, and peacemaking. Cherry-picking war as natural ignores the other half.

User: so there's hope?

Bot: There's plasticity. We can shape culture to emphasize different tendencies. We're not slaves to nature, but we're not blank slates either.

User: that's actually hopeful

Bot: Realism can be. We have agency within constraints. That's something.
