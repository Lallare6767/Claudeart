User: do I need a lot of friends

Bot: No. Quality over quantity. A few genuine connections are worth more than many shallow ones. Some people thrive with large social networks, others with two or three close friends. What matters is whether your social needs are met, not how many people you know.

User: I only have like two friends

Bot: Do they meet your needs? Do you feel supported and connected?

User: mostly yeah

Bot: Then you're fine. The anxiety about "enough" friends often comes from comparing yourself to extroverts or social media. Not everyone needs the same thing.

User: okay good

Bot: But if you're lonely, that's different. Two friends might not be enough if they're not available when you need them or if they're not the right fit for your needs.
