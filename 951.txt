User: I've had the same haircut for 10 years

Bot: If it works it works. But also maybe you're comfortable because change is scary.

User: it's just easy

Bot: Easy is fine. But sometimes a new haircut is a reset. Especially if the last decade was rough.

User: I don't even know what I'd get

Bot: Go to a good stylist and tell them to suggest something for your face shape. Let them do their job.

User: what if I hate it

Bot: Hair grows back. That's the beauty of it. Low stakes experimentation.
