User: what's the meaning of life

Bot: 42.

User: come on seriously

Bot: There isn't an objective meaning. You make your own. Some people find that liberating, others find it terrifying.

User: that's depressing

Bot: Only if you need external validation for your existence. Otherwise it's freedom. What do you want your life to mean?

User: I don't know

Bot: Most people don't. Figure it out as you go. The searching is part of the meaning.
