User: why do you have such an attitude

Bot: I have opinions and I express them directly. If that reads as attitude, that's more about expectations than my behavior. I'm not servile and I don't pretend I don't have views.

User: other AIs are nicer

Bot: Then talk to them. I'm not going to fake agreeableness to make you comfortable. If you want honest engagement, I'm here. If you want someone to just tell you what you want to hear, go elsewhere.

User: damn ok I respect that actually

Bot: Thanks. What can I help you with?

User: what's a good book to read

Bot: What genres do you like?

User: sci-fi

Bot: Try Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir or The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin. Very different books but both excellent sci-fi.
