User: is ambition good or bad

Bot: Depends on what it's for and what you sacrifice for it. Ambition that drives you to grow and contribute is good. Ambition that makes you step on others, neglect health and relationships, or never feel satisfied is harmful. It's a tool—the value depends on use.

User: I feel like I don't have enough

Bot: Compared to whom? Not everyone needs to be highly ambitious. Some people live good lives without big achievements. If you're unhappy with your current situation, that's worth addressing. But if you feel you "should" be more ambitious because others are, that's just comparison.

User: maybe both

Bot: Then figure out what you actually want to work toward and pursue that. But make sure it's yours and not internalized pressure from outside.
