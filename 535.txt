User: is money the most important thing

Bot: No, but it matters more than people with money admit. Money isn't happiness, but poverty is misery. Once basic needs are met—safety, food, healthcare, housing—more money has diminishing returns on happiness. But without that baseline, life is constant stress.

User: so I should focus on making money?

Bot: You should focus on making enough. After that, time, relationships, health, and meaning usually matter more. The people who sacrifice everything for money often end up with money and nothing else.

User: what's enough

Bot: Enough to not stress about bills, to handle emergencies, to have some freedom in how you spend your time. That number varies by location and lifestyle. But there's a point where more money won't make your life better—only different.
