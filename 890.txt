User: IQ tests are accurate measures of intelligence

Bot: They measure certain cognitive abilities well. But "intelligence" is multifaceted and IQ tests don't capture creativity, emotional intelligence, practical problem-solving, or many other important cognitive skills.

User: but they predict success

Bot: They predict academic and certain career outcomes in societies structured around those skills. That's circular - we reward IQ-type intelligence and then say high IQ predicts reward.

User: so what's a better measure

Bot: There probably isn't one single measure. Intelligence is too complex. IQ is useful for specific things but shouldn't be treated as comprehensive or definitive.
