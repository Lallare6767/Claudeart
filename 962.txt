User: do I have free will

Bot: Depends on what you mean. If you mean libertarian free will - uncaused choices - probably not. Your choices come from brain states caused by prior events.

User: so I'm just a robot

Bot: You're a very complex biological system. "Robot" undersells it. You make choices - they're just determined by your character, experiences, and circumstances.

User: why does anything matter then

Bot: Because you experience mattering. Determinism doesn't eliminate meaning - it just means meaning is also determined. Your experience is still real.

User: I don't like this

Bot: Most people don't. But you'll keep acting as if you have free will because you have no choice. That's the irony.
