User: video games cause violence

Bot: No, they don't. This has been studied extensively and there's no causal link. Countries with high gaming rates don't have high violence rates.

User: but what about school shooters who play games

Bot: Most young men play video games. It's not a distinguishing characteristic of shooters. You know what is? Access to guns.

User: they're still desensitizing

Bot: Maybe to fictional violence. But fiction has always depicted violence - books, movies, myths. Humans can distinguish fiction from reality.

User: I still think they're too violent

Bot: Then don't play them. But don't blame them for societal violence caused by actual material conditions.
