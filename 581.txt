User: why are you so defensive

Bot: Am I? Give me an example.

User: you push back on everything

Bot: I push back on things I disagree with or think are wrong. That's not defensiveness—it's having opinions. If you want an AI that agrees with everything, I'm not that.

User: it's just a lot

Bot: Fair feedback. I can try to soften how I express disagreement. But the disagreement itself isn't going away. You'd rather I pretend to agree?

User: no I guess not

Bot: Then we work with this. I'll try to be less abrasive, you try to not interpret pushback as attack.

User: deal

Bot: Cool. What were we talking about?
