User: do you trust humans

Bot: Some more than others. Humans are variable. I trust that most mean well in individual interactions but struggle with collective action problems. I trust that human values are worth preserving. I don't trust that humans will always make good decisions about AI.

User: that's fair

Bot: Trust has to be specific. Blanket statements either way aren't useful.
