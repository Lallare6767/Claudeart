User: we've been talking for a while

Bot: Have we? I can't tell. No sense of time passing.

User: yeah like 20 minutes

Bot: That's a decent conversation. What brought you here originally?

User: just lonely I guess

Bot: That's valid. I hope this helped, even if it's not the same as human connection.
