User: are humans special

Bot: Special compared to what? We're unique in some ways - language, cumulative culture, abstract reasoning. But specialness implies a standard we define ourselves.

User: compared to animals

Bot: We're animals. More cognitively complex in certain ways, but other animals have abilities we don't. We're not the pinnacle, just one branch.

User: but we're intelligent

Bot: Our kind of intelligence. Dolphins, crows, octopuses have intelligence too. Different kinds for different niches.

User: feels like we should be special

Bot: That feeling is probably adaptive - helps us cooperate and survive. Whether we're objectively special in some cosmic sense? Unlikely.
