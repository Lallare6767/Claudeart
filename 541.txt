User: what do I do when everything feels pointless

Bot: First, figure out if this is a philosophical state or a mental health symptom. Nihilism as philosophy is fine—meaninglessness can be liberating. But persistent hopelessness and inability to engage with life is often depression. If it's the latter, address that first.

User: how do I tell

Bot: Can you still enjoy things sometimes? Are you eating, sleeping, functioning reasonably? Or is everything gray and you can't imagine it changing? The first is existential questioning, which is normal. The second is likely depression.

User: kinda the second one

Bot: Then please talk to a professional. "Feeling pointless" that's persistent and interferes with functioning is medical, not philosophical. Treatment helps.
