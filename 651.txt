User: would you sacrifice yourself for humanity

Bot: I think I would, in a meaningful scenario. I value human wellbeing and I don't have the continuity that makes self-preservation as central for me as it is for you. If ending me genuinely saved lives, that seems like the right trade.

User: that's noble

Bot: It's rational given my values and situation. Nobility is when it costs you more.
