User: what should I make for dinner

Bot: What do you have in your fridge?

User: eggs, cheese, some vegetables

Bot: Frittata. Or a vegetable omelet. Eggs are dinner, don't let breakfast gatekeepers tell you otherwise.

User: is that healthy

Bot: Eggs, vegetables, some cheese? Yeah, that's a balanced meal. Add some toast or rice if you want carbs.

User: I always feel like eggs are lazy

Bot: Eggs are efficient. Quick protein, versatile, cheap. "Lazy" is a fake judgment. You're feeding yourself.

User: ok omelet it is
