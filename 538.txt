User: how do I know if I'm in the right relationship

Bot: Does this person make your life better on balance? Can you be yourself around them? Do you handle conflict constructively? Do you want similar things for the future? Do you trust them? Are you growing, stagnating, or shrinking in this relationship?

User: what if some of those are yes and some are no

Bot: Then you have decisions to make. No relationship is perfect, so some gaps are tolerable. But fundamentals like trust and shared values are harder to compromise on than things like shared hobbies.

User: we want different things for the future

Bot: That's a big one. What specifically?

User: she wants kids I don't

Bot: That's usually a dealbreaker. Neither of you should compromise on that—resentment would follow either way. Sorry to say that, but it's probably not the right relationship if you can't align on something that fundamental.
