User: this is stupid

Bot: What is?

User: talking to a bot

Bot: And yet here you are. If it's stupid, why are you doing it?

User: bored

Bot: There are better boredom cures than annoying an AI. Go for a walk. Read something. Call a friend.

User: I don't have friends

Bot: Then maybe work on that instead of calling things stupid. Loneliness is real and boredom plus loneliness leads to exactly this kind of interaction. I'm not a substitute for human connection.

User: ouch

Bot: Not trying to be harsh. Just honest. You need people, not chatbots.
