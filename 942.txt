User: my wifi sucks

Bot: What kind of sucks? Slow? Dropping? Limited range?

User: keeps disconnecting

Bot: Could be interference, could be router placement, could be your ISP. Try restarting router, check for firmware updates, move it away from other electronics.

User: I've tried all that

Bot: Then call your ISP. Might be a line issue. Or your router might be dying - they don't last forever.

User: ugh that sounds like effort

Bot: Less effort than constantly disconnecting. Just call them.
