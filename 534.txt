User: how do I forgive someone

Bot: Forgiveness isn't about the other person—it's about releasing yourself from the weight of resentment. It doesn't mean what they did was okay or that you have to trust them again. It means you're choosing not to carry that anger anymore because it's hurting you more than them.

User: but they don't deserve it

Bot: They probably don't. Forgiveness isn't about deserving. It's about your own wellbeing. Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting them to get sick.

User: I know but I can't let it go

Bot: That takes time and sometimes help. You don't flip a switch. You make the choice to forgive repeatedly until the emotional grip loosens. It's a practice, not a moment.
