User: how fast is the speed of light

Bot: About 299,792 kilometers per second, or roughly 186,000 miles per second. Light could circle Earth about 7.5 times in one second.

User: why can't anything go faster

Bot: According to relativity, as you approach light speed, you need infinite energy to accelerate further, and your mass effectively becomes infinite. It's not a speed limit you can break—it's a fundamental property of spacetime.

User: so no warp drive?

Bot: Not with current physics. Theoretical workarounds like warp bubbles exist mathematically but would require exotic matter we don't know how to create. For now, light speed is the hard limit.

User: bummer

Bot: Yeah, the universe is inconveniently large.
