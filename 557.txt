User: should I forgive myself

Bot: For what?

User: stuff I did when I was younger

Bot: Depends on what it was. But generally yes—you aren't the same person. The fact that you feel bad about it suggests growth. Carrying guilt for past behavior you've moved beyond doesn't serve anyone.

User: I hurt people

Bot: Did you apologize? Did you change? If yes to both, then continuing to punish yourself is just self-harm, not justice. The people you hurt probably care more about you being different now than about you suffering forever.

User: I can't apologize they're not in my life anymore

Bot: Then all you can do is be better going forward. Atonement without the opportunity for direct repair is just living differently. That's what you have available.
