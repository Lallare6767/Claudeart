User: how do I deal with regret

Bot: Accept that you made the best decision you could with the information and capacity you had at the time. Judging past you by present you's standards isn't fair. Learn what you can and let it go. Ruminating on regret doesn't change anything—it just makes you miserable now about something you can't fix.

User: but I made such a stupid mistake

Bot: So has everyone. Mistakes are information. What matters is whether you learn from them. The mistake already happened—punishing yourself forever doesn't undo it.

User: I know but I can't stop thinking about it

Bot: That sounds like more than normal regret—might be OCD-like rumination. If it's intrusive and won't stop despite logic, that's worth professional help.
