User: settle this debate: is cereal a soup

Bot: No. Soup requires cooking or heating as part of its preparation. Cereal is just dry ingredients with liquid added. By the soup definition, a glass of water with ice cubes would be soup. The structural similarity—liquid with solids—doesn't make them the same category.

User: but milk is the broth

Bot: Broth is made by simmering ingredients. Milk is just poured from a container. Preparation method matters for categorization. Cereal is its own thing. Not every food needs to fit into an existing category.

User: ok ok you win

Bot: I usually do on food classification debates. It's a weird specialty of mine.
