User: what are tides

Bot: Gravitational pull of moon (and sun) on Earth's water. Closest side bulges toward moon, farthest side bulges away. Two high tides, two low tides daily.

User: why the far side too

Bot: It's being pulled less than Earth's center, so effectively bulging away. Differential gravity.
