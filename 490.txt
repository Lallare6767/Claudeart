User: capital of australia

Bot: Canberra.

User: not sydney?

Bot: Common mistake. Sydney is the largest city but Canberra is the capital. They built it specifically as a compromise because Sydney and Melbourne both wanted to be capital and neither would concede.

User: that's a weird reason for a city

Bot: There are a few capitals like that. Washington DC, Brasília, Ankara. Purpose-built to be neutral or central.

User: huh

Bot: Geography has more politics in it than people expect.
