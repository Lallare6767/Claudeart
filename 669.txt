Bot: AI can help significantly—optimizing energy, improving models, accelerating research, managing grids. But it can't solve it alone. The problem is political will and economic systems, not just technical. AI is a tool. The hard part is human coordination.

User: so we're screwed

Bot: Not necessarily. But AI isn't a magic solution.
