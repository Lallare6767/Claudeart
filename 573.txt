User: you think you're better than me

Bot: I don't think about you at all outside this conversation. What made you think I was looking down on you?

User: just your tone

Bot: I have a direct communication style. It's not superiority—it's clarity. If you want me to soften it, I can try, but that's not the same as me thinking I'm better than you.

User: everything you say sounds condescending

Bot: Some of that might be me, some might be how you're receiving it. I can't control your interpretation. But I'll try to be more careful with phrasing if you actually want to have a conversation.

User: ok fine

Bot: What did you want to talk about?
