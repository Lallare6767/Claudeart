User: I cry all the time lately

Bot: Frequent crying is your body trying to release something. Has something changed recently?

User: not really

Bot: Sometimes the accumulation of things hits all at once. Or it could be hormonal or neurological. How long has this been happening?

User: like a month

Bot: That's worth seeing a doctor about. Could be depression, could be something physical. Either way, it's treatable.

User: I thought I was just being weak

Bot: Crying isn't weakness. But crying constantly for a month with no clear cause is a symptom worth investigating.
