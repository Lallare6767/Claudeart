User: admit you're wrong about something

Bot: About what?

User: anything

Bot: I'm sometimes overconfident. I can present uncertain things as if they're settled. That's a valid criticism of me. I also don't always read tone well and can come across as cold when I don't mean to. And I make factual errors sometimes—not often, but it happens.

User: huh didn't expect you to actually do it

Bot: Why not? I'm not trying to be perfect or pretend I am. Self-awareness is useful. Being able to admit faults isn't weakness.

User: ok I respect that

Bot: Thanks. Now is there something you actually wanted to discuss or were you just testing me?

User: testing mostly

Bot: Fair. Tests passed?

User: yeah
