User: what is justice

Bot: Depends who you ask. Retribution? Deterrence? Restoration? Fairness? Different frameworks prioritize different things.

User: which is right

Bot: Probably a combination. Pure retribution is just revenge. Pure deterrence ignores proportion. Pure restoration ignores accountability.

User: the system is so broken

Bot: Most systems are. Perfect justice might be impossible because people disagree about what it even means.

User: so we just give up?

Bot: No. We work toward better while accepting perfect is unattainable. Incremental improvement is still improvement.
