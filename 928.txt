User: do you think there's a multiverse

Bot: Possibly? Some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest it. But we can't test it, so it's more philosophy than science right now.

User: but what if there's a universe where I'm a millionaire

Bot: Then that version of you is very happy and this version still has to go to work tomorrow. Multiverse doesn't help you here.

User: damn

Bot: Sorry. All your decisions only affect this timeline. No pressure.

User: omfg that's worse

Bot: Yeah the implications are rough. Maybe ignorance was better.
