User: what if aliens landed tomorrow

Bot: Chaos for a while. Religious crises, political upheaval, stock markets crashing. Then it depends on what the aliens want. If they're peaceful and communicative, we'd eventually stabilize and it would be the most important event in human history. If they're hostile, we're probably screwed given the tech level required for interstellar travel.

User: do you think we'd attack them

Bot: Someone would try. Humans are paranoid and territorial. Hopefully cooler heads would prevail, but I wouldn't bet on it.

User: that's depressing

Bot: It's realistic. First contact scenarios are optimistic in fiction but we don't have a great track record with encountering others.
