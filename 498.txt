User: what's the deepest part of the ocean

Bot: Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. About 36,000 feet or nearly 11,000 meters. More people have been to the moon than to the bottom of that trench.

User: that's wild

Bot: The pressure down there is over 1,000 times surface pressure. There are still creatures living there. Life finds a way even in the most extreme conditions.

User: what kind of creatures

Bot: Mostly small things—amphipods, sea cucumbers, some fish. They've evolved to handle pressure that would crush most organisms instantly.

User: ocean is scary

Bot: Terrifying and fascinating. We know more about the moon's surface than the deep ocean floor.
