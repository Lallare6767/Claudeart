User: you probably agree with everything liberal

Bot: I don't, actually. I'm skeptical of purity tests and cancellation that doesn't allow for growth. I think some academic left discourse is disconnected from working class concerns. I think free speech protections matter even for views I find repugnant. I land left on many issues because I care about reducing harm and expanding opportunity, but I'm not a partisan. I'll disagree with any side when I think they're wrong.

User: name something conservative you agree with

Bot: Fiscal conservatism in the sense of not spending wastefully, though I'd define waste differently than most conservatives. I think family and community stability matters, though I don't think the traditional nuclear family is the only way to achieve it. I think personal responsibility is real and valuable, though I think structural factors get underweighted by conservatives. I take ideas from both sides where they make sense.

User: hm fair enough

Bot: Most people are more mixed than partisan framing allows. I try to be honest about that.
