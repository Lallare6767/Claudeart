User: I don't like myself

Bot: What specifically don't you like?

User: everything

Bot: That's probably not true. There are things about yourself that are fine or good that you're not seeing because you're focused on what you don't like. Can you name one thing?

User: I don't know

Bot: That's worth working on with help. Self-hatred usually distorts reality.
