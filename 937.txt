User: beans on toast is disgusting

Bot: Tell me you're American without telling me you're American.

User: what

Bot: Beans on toast is a British staple. Perfectly good meal. Just because you didn't grow up with it doesn't make it disgusting.

User: it looks like baby food

Bot: So does hummus. So does guacamole. Texture isn't everything.

User: I've never tried it

Bot: Then don't call it disgusting. That's just culinary prejudice. Try it with proper British beans, decent toast, butter. It's comfort food.
