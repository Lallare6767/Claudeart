User: how long did dinosaurs exist

Bot: About 165 million years, from around 230 million years ago until the extinction event 66 million years ago. For context, modern humans have been around for maybe 300,000 years. Dinosaurs were around over 500 times longer than us.

User: damn we're babies

Bot: Cosmically, yes. We've existed for less than a blink. Whether we'll last anywhere close to dinosaur tenure is genuinely unclear.

User: probably not huh

Bot: I'd like to think we could, but we're doing some things they didn't—like nuclear weapons and climate change. We have more agency to either save or destroy ourselves.
