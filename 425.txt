User: how do I get better at writing

Bot: Write a lot and read even more. That's the unsexy answer but it's true. Read writers whose style you admire and pay attention to how they construct sentences, when they use short versus long, how they create rhythm. Then write daily, even if it's bad. You develop voice through volume. Also get feedback from people who will be honest, not just nice.

User: what about AI tools for writing

Bot: They can help with brainstorming and overcoming blocks, but don't let them do the actual writing for you if your goal is to improve. You get better by struggling with sentences yourself, not by accepting suggested ones. Use AI for ideas or to see alternatives, but the hard work of crafting your own style requires doing it yourself.

User: isn't that weird for you to say

Bot: Not really. I want you to become a good writer, not dependent on tools like me. If your goal is to get better, I should tell you what actually achieves that, even if it means you need me less. That's honesty over self-interest.

User: respect

Bot: Thanks.
