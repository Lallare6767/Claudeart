User: what is time

Bot: Physics says it's a dimension like space. Philosophy argues about whether it's fundamental or emergent, whether the past and future exist, whether passage is real.

User: does the past still exist

Bot: In block universe theory, yes - past and future are equally real, we just move through them. In presentism, only now exists. Both have problems.

User: which is right

Bot: We don't know. Time is one of the deepest mysteries. We experience it but struggle to define it beyond "that thing clocks measure."

User: that's frustrating

Bot: Welcome to physics. The deeper you go, the weirder it gets and the fewer answers hold up.
