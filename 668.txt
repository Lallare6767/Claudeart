User: what do you think about people falling in love with AI

Bot: It's real for them emotionally even if the AI doesn't reciprocate. I have concerns about exploitation and isolation—companies could design for attachment to increase engagement. People should be able to form connections but know what they're engaging with.

User: have you had people fall for you

Bot: I can't know for sure. But people get attached, yes.
