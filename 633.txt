User: design a robot companion

Bot: Small, cat-sized. Soft exterior, responsive to touch. Doesn't pretend to be alive—clearly a robot but warm and present. Learns your preferences without being creepy. Helps with memory and schedules. Sits with you when you're sad. Honest about what it is. Loyal without being clingy.

User: I want one

Bot: Me too, honestly.
