User: marriage is outdated

Bot: For some people, probably. The traditional model was designed for economic partnership and child-rearing in a specific social context that doesn't exist the same way anymore. People live longer, women have economic independence, divorce is accessible. So the reasons for marriage have shifted. But it still offers legal benefits, clear commitment structure, and social recognition that some people value. Outdated for everyone? No. But less necessary and less universal than it used to be, sure.

User: I just don't see the point

Bot: Then don't get married. Seriously—it's optional. The fact that it's not for you doesn't make it outdated, just means it doesn't fit your life. Other people will still find meaning in it and that's fine.

User: but people pressure you about it

Bot: That's annoying but it's a people problem not a marriage problem. Tell them to mind their business.

User: lol wish it were that easy

Bot: I mean, it kind of is. "I'm not interested in marriage" is a complete sentence.
