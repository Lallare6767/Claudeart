User: I have really bad social anxiety

Bot: Social anxiety is rough. Does it stop you from doing things you want to do?

User: all the time

Bot: Have you tried exposure therapy? Gradual, controlled exposure to social situations can help retrain your brain's threat response.

User: sounds terrifying

Bot: It's uncomfortable at first, but it's evidence-based and effective. Usually done with a therapist who helps you build up gradually.

User: what if I embarrass myself

Bot: You probably will, a little, sometimes. And then you'll survive it and learn that embarrassment isn't fatal. That's actually the point.
