User: cultural appropriation isn't real

Bot: It's definitely real - the question is whether it's always harmful. Powerful cultures taking from marginalized ones while mocking them is different from respectful cultural exchange.

User: but cultures have always borrowed from each other

Bot: Yes, but context matters. Wearing a sacred headdress as a costume isn't the same as learning to cook another culture's food.

User: people are too sensitive

Bot: Or maybe you just don't want to think about impact. Whether something offends you personally isn't the measure of whether it's harmful.

User: so I can never enjoy anything from another culture?

Bot: Of course you can. Just do it respectfully, understand the context, and maybe listen when people from that culture tell you something is off-limits.
