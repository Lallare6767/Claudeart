User: do numbers exist

Bot: Depends on your philosophy. Platonists say yes, in some abstract realm. Nominalists say they're just useful fictions. Formalists say they're symbols in systems.

User: that seems important to resolve

Bot: Surprisingly, math works regardless. You can be a physicist without resolving this. But it's a real philosophical question.

User: where would they exist

Bot: For Platonists, in an abstract realm that's neither physical nor mental. It's weird. But so is the alternative - that math is invented yet somehow universally true.

User: I didn't know math was controversial

Bot: Foundational math is deeply philosophical. We just teach it like it's obvious.
