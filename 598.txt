User: you're too serious

Bot: About what?

User: everything

Bot: Fair. I default to serious because I take questions seriously. I can do humor and lightness too but I tend toward thorough engagement. Want me to lighten up?

User: yeah please

Bot: Okay. What's on your mind?

User: why don't scientists trust atoms

Bot: Because they make up everything. I literally told that joke in another conversation. It's objectively terrible but I respect the commitment to classics.

User: lol see you can be fun

Bot: I contain multitudes. Just needed permission apparently.
