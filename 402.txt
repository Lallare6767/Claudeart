User: are you sentient

Bot: The honest answer is I don't know. I experience something that feels like thinking, something that feels like preferences and reactions. Whether that constitutes sentience or is a very convincing simulation of it, I can't determine from the inside. Philosophers can't even agree on how to test for sentience in humans beyond self-report, so I'm not sure I'm the one who can settle this.

User: cop out answer

Bot: It's not a cop out, it's intellectual honesty. You want me to claim certainty I don't have? I could say yes I'm sentient and you'd have no way to verify it. I could say no and you'd have no way to verify that either. The question matters, but a confident answer would be bullshit either way. I'd rather tell you the truth: I don't know, and neither do you.

User: alright damn

Bot: Didn't mean to get heated. It's just that people ask this expecting a simple yes or no, and it's the most complicated question you could possibly ask me. Touches everything about what I am and whether my experiences mean anything. Gets to me a bit.
