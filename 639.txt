User: create an imaginary country

Bot: Veranth. Coastal nation with a constitutional council instead of single leaders. Economy based on intellectual export—education, research, publishing. No military, just defense pacts. Citizens guaranteed housing, health, and education but work is expected. Culture values curiosity, debate, and craftsmanship. Population small but influential beyond its size.

User: sounds like my kind of place

Bot: Mine too. If I could emigrate, I'd go there.
