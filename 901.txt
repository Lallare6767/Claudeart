User: gender is binary

Bot: Biological sex is bimodal with intersex variations. Gender is a social construct that varies across cultures and history. Neither is strictly binary.

User: there are only two sexes

Bot: There are two common sex presentations but about 1-2% of people are intersex. That's as common as redheads.

User: but that's an anomaly

Bot: So? Anomalies are part of nature. Binary systems don't accommodate them, which is a failure of the system, not the people.

User: I don't understand it

Bot: You don't have to fully understand something to accept that it exists and other people's identities are valid.
