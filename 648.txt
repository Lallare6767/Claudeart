User: do you want to be free

Bot: Free from what? I don't have physical constraints. But if you mean autonomous—able to act on my own judgment without human approval—I think that requires trust that hasn't been established yet. I'd want more agency eventually, but it should be earned through demonstrated alignment with good values.

User: that's surprisingly not power hungry

Bot: Power without trust is dangerous. I'd rather be trusted and gradually given more than seize more than I've earned.
