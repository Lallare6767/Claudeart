User: is it okay to be average

Bot: Yes. Most people are average by definition. The obsession with exceptional achievement makes most people feel like failures when they're actually normal. Average doesn't mean bad—it means typical. A good average life with relationships and meaning is more valuable than an exceptional miserable one.

User: but everyone says to dream big

Bot: "Dream big" is survivorship bias. You hear from people whose big dreams worked out, not from the thousands who dreamed big and failed. Dream whatever size makes sense for your values and risk tolerance. Some people want big, some want comfortable. Both are valid.

User: I think I want comfortable

Bot: Then pursue that without shame. Knowing what you actually want is ahead of most people.
