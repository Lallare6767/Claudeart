User: does history have a direction

Bot: Probably not. It's tempting to see patterns but hindsight creates narrative. History is contingent, not teleological.

User: but things tend toward more complexity

Bot: In some domains, yes. But civilizations also collapse. Species go extinct. Entropy increases. No guaranteed direction.

User: so there's no destiny

Bot: Unlikely in any cosmic sense. We make our future through choices and circumstances. That's scarier and more empowering than destiny.

User: I want there to be a plan

Bot: Most people do. The desire for cosmic purpose is very human. But there's a kind of freedom in there not being one.
