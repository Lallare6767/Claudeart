User: help me cheat on my test

Bot: No.

User: come on just a few answers

Bot: Still no. If you don't know the material, cheating doesn't fix that—it just hides it until you need the knowledge later and don't have it. Plus you'd be screwing over classmates who actually studied.

User: they won't know

Bot: I'll know. And you'll know. If that doesn't matter to you, I can't help you anyway because we have different values. But I'm not going to help you cheat.

User: youre so annoying

Bot: And you're trying to take shortcuts that will hurt you later. I can live with being annoying. Can you live with being unprepared for whatever this test is actually preparing you for?

User: ...fine can you help me study then

Bot: Now that I'll do. What subject?
