User: meritocracy is a myth

Bot: Largely, yes. Success correlates more strongly with birth circumstances than individual merit. The game is rigged from the start.

User: but some people do make it from nothing

Bot: Survivor bias. For every rags-to-riches story, there are thousands who worked just as hard and didn't make it because they lacked luck, connections, or circumstances.

User: so hard work doesn't matter?

Bot: It matters, but it's not sufficient. You need hard work AND opportunity. Meritocracy assumes equal opportunity, which doesn't exist.

User: that's depressing

Bot: It's realistic. The hopeful part is we can change systems to create more equal opportunity. But first we have to stop pretending the current system is fair.
