User: cancel culture is out of control

Bot: Define "cancel culture." Public figures facing consequences for their actions? That's always existed. Pile-ons that ruin random people's lives? That's concerning.

User: people get cancelled for things they said years ago

Bot: Sometimes fairly, sometimes not. Teenage edgelord tweets are different from adult patterns of behavior. Context matters.

User: but no forgiveness anymore

Bot: Some people do get second chances. Others don't. It's not a monolith. But also - people aren't entitled to forgiveness. Consequences exist.

User: the mob mentality is scary

Bot: It can be. But "cancel culture" is also a term used to deflect legitimate criticism. When powerful people face accountability, they call it cancellation.
