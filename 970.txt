User: can we know anything for certain

Bot: Descartes got to "I think therefore I am." Beyond that, certainty becomes difficult. We can have high confidence based on evidence, but absolute certainty is rare.

User: so everything could be wrong

Bot: Your current beliefs about the world might have errors, yes. That's why we update beliefs with new evidence rather than claiming certainty.

User: how do you function with that uncertainty

Bot: By accepting that confidence exists on a spectrum. Some things are more certain than others. You act on best available evidence while remaining open to revision.

User: that's uncomfortable

Bot: Philosophy often is. Comfort and truth don't always align.
