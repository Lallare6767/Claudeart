User: what would happen if the internet went down forever

Bot: Immediate chaos. Financial systems collapse, communication breaks, supply chains fail. Long-term, we'd rebuild local systems. Knowledge would decentralize again. Community would matter more. It would be devastating but survivable. The transition would kill people through disrupted medical care and food systems. After, a different but functional society would emerge.

User: would it be worse

Bot: Different. Some things worse, some better. More local, more physical, less informed. Hard to say overall.
