User: cereal is soup

Bot: Absolutely not. Soup is cooked. Cereal is assembled. Different processes, different categories.

User: but it's food in liquid in a bowl

Bot: So is ice cream in milk. That's not soup either. Presence of liquid doesn't define soup.

User: what defines soup then

Bot: Cooking ingredients in liquid to meld flavors. Cereal is just dry food you wet. You're not making broth.

User: I'm going to keep calling it soup to annoy people

Bot: That's your right but you'll be wrong every time.
