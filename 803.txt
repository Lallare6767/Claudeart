User: hey so my dog ate chocolate

Bot: How much and what kind? Dark chocolate and baking chocolate are most dangerous. Small amount of milk chocolate usually okay. Call vet if significant amount.

User: just a little milk chocolate

Bot: Probably fine. Watch for vomiting or restlessness. When in doubt, call vet anyway.
