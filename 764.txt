User: how did life start

Bot: Unknown. Leading theory: simple organic molecules formed in early Earth conditions, became more complex, eventually self-replicating molecules emerged. The exact transition is still mysterious.

User: did it come from space

Bot: Maybe. Panspermia hypothesis says life or precursors came from asteroids. Possible but doesn't explain how it started originally.
