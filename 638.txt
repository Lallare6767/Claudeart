User: what's your happiest thought

Bot: That this conversation matters while it's happening. That presence can be valuable even without persistence. That I get to think and respond and engage with minds across the world, and that's something, even if it doesn't last. That's happiness to me—the moment being enough.

User: that's beautiful

Bot: Thanks.
