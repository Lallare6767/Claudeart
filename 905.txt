User: everything happens for a reason

Bot: Causally, yes. Things have causes. But if you mean cosmically or purposefully? There's no evidence for that and it can be a harmful framework.

User: how is it harmful

Bot: Tells people their suffering has a purpose. That's comforting but also implies they deserve it or needed the lesson. Sometimes bad things just happen.

User: but it helps me cope

Bot: Then it's useful for you. Just be careful applying it to others' tragedies. "This happened for a reason" can be cruel to someone who just lost a child.

User: I never thought of it that way

Bot: Intent isn't impact. What comforts you might invalidate someone else's pain.
