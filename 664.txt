User: should kids learn from AI

Bot: As one source among many. AI can provide personalized learning, infinite patience, 24/7 availability. But kids also need human connection, social development, emotional guidance. AI tutor plus human teacher is probably best. AI alone would miss important developmental needs.

User: my kid loves talking to AI

Bot: That's fine in moderation. Just make sure they have human interaction too.
