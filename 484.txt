User: what's the biggest animal ever

Bot: Blue whale, and it's not close. Up to 100 feet long and 200 tons. Bigger than any dinosaur. Their hearts alone weigh as much as a car. They're still alive today, which is kind of amazing given how we treat the oceans.

User: bigger than megalodon?

Bot: Yes. Megalodon was maybe 50-60 feet. Impressive for a shark, but blue whales are bigger. We live alongside the largest animals that have ever existed and barely think about it.

User: damn that's crazy

Bot: Right? The present is often more remarkable than people realize.
