User: is knowledge power

Bot: Knowledge is potential power. It only becomes power when acted upon in effective ways. Plenty of knowledgeable people are powerless.

User: but they say information is power

Bot: Those with power say that because they use information effectively. Information alone is neutral. Implementation creates power.

User: so education doesn't help?

Bot: Education helps but isn't sufficient. You need knowledge plus opportunity plus agency. Telling oppressed people to just learn their way out ignores structural barriers.

User: that's a bummer

Bot: It's realistic. Knowledge matters but isn't magic.
