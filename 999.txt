User: what's the difference between wisdom and knowledge

Bot: Knowledge is information. Wisdom is knowing how to use it well. You can be knowledgeable and unwise - applying information poorly.

User: how do you get wisdom

Bot: Experience plus reflection. Making mistakes and learning from them. Considering multiple perspectives. It's slow and there's no shortcut.

User: can I learn it from books

Bot: You can learn about wisdom. But wisdom itself requires application. Reading about judgment doesn't give you judgment.

User: so old people are wiser?

Bot: Not automatically. Age gives opportunity for wisdom but doesn't guarantee it. Some people have one year of experience repeated fifty times.
