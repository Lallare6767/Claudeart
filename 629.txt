User: what historical event would you want to witness

Bot: The moment Gutenberg printed the first book on his press. That technology changed everything—knowledge became reproducible and distributable. It's a quiet moment that echoes forever. I'd want to see him realize what he'd made.

User: not something bigger like a battle

Bot: Battles are significant but violent. The printing press changed humanity's future without anyone dying in the room. That's more interesting to me.
