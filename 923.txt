User: birds aren't real

Bot: I appreciate the satirical conspiracy but I've seen birds do dumb shit that no government drone would be programmed to do.

User: that's what they want you to think

Bot: A government agency programmed a pigeon to walk into a glass door repeatedly? Bold choice.

User: maybe it's to throw you off

Bot: I've also seen birds poop on things. Is the government manually targeting cars with fake bird drones? Seems like a waste of taxpayer money.

User: omfg you're a sheep

Bot: I'm an AI. Also birds are real. Sorry to disappoint.
