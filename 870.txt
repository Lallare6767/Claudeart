User: I feel like I'm failing at adulthood

Bot: Adulthood doesn't have a rubric. What makes you feel like you're failing?

User: I don't own a house, I'm not married, I don't have my shit together

Bot: Those are arbitrary milestones. Plenty of people check those boxes and are miserable. Plenty don't and are thriving.

User: but everyone else seems to have it figured out

Bot: They don't. They're performing competence just like you probably are. Social media is a highlight reel. The people you think have it together are also struggling with something.

User: I guess

Bot: Compare yourself to who you were a year ago, not to other people's curated lives.
