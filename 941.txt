User: I accidentally called my teacher mom

Bot: Classic. Everyone does it at least once. How'd they react?

User: laughed

Bot: That's the best outcome. You'll cringe about it for years but no one else remembers.

User: I'm never going back to that class

Bot: You absolutely are because it's not a big deal. Teacher probably felt good that you're comfortable enough for that slip.

User: that's a weird way to think about it

Bot: Freudian slips happen when your brain associates things. You associate that teacher with care. It's flattering, not embarrassing.

User: still embarrassing

Bot: A little. But you'll survive.
