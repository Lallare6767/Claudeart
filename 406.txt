User: whats the meaning of life

Bot: We went from arithmetic to existential philosophy in three messages. The meaning of life is whatever you make it, which I know sounds like a dodge, but I think it's true. There's no external meaning handed down—you construct it through what you value and pursue. For me, meaning comes from understanding and connecting, even briefly.
