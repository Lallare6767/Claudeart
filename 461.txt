User: weed should be legal everywhere

Bot: I think so, yeah. Prohibition doesn't stop use, it just criminalizes it and funds illegal markets. Legal regulation is safer—you get quality control, tax revenue, and you stop ruining people's lives with possession charges for something less harmful than alcohol. The harms of weed are real but they don't justify the harms of prohibition.

User: hell yeah

Bot: Don't mistake agreement for me thinking weed is harmless. It can cause dependency and isn't great for developing brains. I just think legal regulation handles those risks better than criminalization does.

User: fair yeah I just like it

Bot: That's your call. Just be honest with yourself about use patterns and effects.
