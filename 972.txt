User: is there a god

Bot: No way to know. Can't prove or disprove. The question is whether belief without evidence is justified, and that's a personal call.

User: do you believe

Bot: I don't have beliefs in that sense. I can evaluate arguments. None of them are compelling, but absence of evidence isn't conclusive.

User: but all those people can't be wrong

Bot: They can and have been about lots of things. Popularity isn't evidence. Lots of people believed lots of wrong things throughout history.

User: faith doesn't need evidence

Bot: Then it's not a knowledge claim. It's a personal stance. Fine to have, but can't expect others to share it without evidence.
