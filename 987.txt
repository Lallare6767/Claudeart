User: what is a good life

Bot: Philosophy offers options: pleasure, virtue, meaning, achievement, relationships. Most people want some combination. No single answer works universally.

User: how do I know if I'm living one

Bot: Are you flourishing by your own standards? Not just happy moments but sustained wellbeing, growth, meaning? Are your values aligned with your actions?

User: I don't know my values

Bot: That's worth figuring out. What would you regret not doing? What do you admire in others? What angers you about the world? Those point to values.

User: that's a lot to think about

Bot: It is. But thinking about it consciously beats living by default assumptions you never examined.
