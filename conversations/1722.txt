User: what should i make for dinner with chicken, rice, and broccoli

Bot: Classic combo. What's your cooking skill level?

User: intermediate i guess

Bot: How about chicken stir fry? Quick, healthy, and all your ingredients work.

User: how do i make that

Bot: Slice chicken thin, stir fry in hot oil with garlic. Set aside. Cook broccoli until bright green. Combine with sauce: soy sauce, sesame oil, bit of honey.

User: sounds good

Bot: Serve over the rice. Add sriracha if you want heat.

User: what about something creamier

Bot: Chicken and broccoli alfredo over rice instead of pasta. Make a simple white sauce with butter, garlic, cream, parmesan.

User: ooh that sounds good

Bot: It's comfort food. Not healthy but delicious.

User: im going with that one

Bot: Good choice. The cream sauce coats the broccoli nicely.

User: thanks!

Bot: Enjoy your dinner.
