User: my kid is being bullied

Bot: I'm sorry. How old?

User: 11

Bot: Is the school aware?

User: yes but nothing changes

Bot: Document everything. Dates, incidents, who you spoke to.

User: why

Bot: Paper trail. If it escalates, you need evidence.

User: should i talk to the bully's parents

Bot: Usually makes it worse. Go through official channels.

User: my kid doesnt want me to make a big deal

Bot: Understandable. But some things require adult intervention.

User: what do i say to them

Bot: Validate their feelings. Ask what they need from you. Make sure they know it's not their fault.

User: theyre so sad

Bot: Of course they are. Being targeted is painful.

User: i feel helpless

Bot: You're not. Keep pushing the school. Escalate if needed.

User: to who

Bot: Principal, superintendent, school board. Document everything as you go.

User: ok

Bot: Your kid needs to know you're fighting for them even if it feels slow.

User: thanks

Bot: They're lucky to have you advocating for them.
