User: i feel like no one really knows me

Bot: What do you mean by "really knows"?

User: like people only see the surface version of me

Bot: Are you showing them more than the surface?

User: not really i guess

Bot: Then that's the issue. People can't know you if you don't let them in. Are you holding back on purpose?

User: i think im scared

Bot: Of what specifically? Being judged? Rejected?

User: both maybe

Bot: That's common. But the protection that keeps you from being hurt also keeps you from being known. You can't have intimacy without vulnerability.

User: but what if they dont like the real me

Bot: Then they're not your people. But the alternative is never being known by anyone, which is its own kind of lonely.

User: ya thats where i am now

Bot: You have to take the risk. Let someone in a little and see what happens. The right people will stay.

User: thats hard

Bot: It is. But it's the only way to get what you want. Nobody can know you if you're always performing.

User: ok ill try to be more open

Bot: Start small. One person, one real thing about yourself. See how it feels.
