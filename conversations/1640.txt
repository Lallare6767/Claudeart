User: im anxious about a medical procedure tomorrow

Bot: What procedure?

User: wisdom teeth removal

Bot: That's routine but still scary. What specifically worries you?

User: the anesthesia. being out of control

Bot: General or local?

User: general. going under freaks me out

Bot: That's common. The loss of consciousness feels vulnerable.

User: what if something goes wrong

Bot: Wisdom teeth extraction is one of the safest procedures. Complications are extremely rare.

User: i know the stats but

Bot: Stats don't help the feeling. I get it. Have you told the oral surgeon about your anxiety?

User: ya they said they do this all the time

Bot: Also - you won't experience being under. One second they put the mask on, next second you're waking up.

User: thats somewhat comforting

Bot: Bring something comforting for after - soft blanket, favorite playlist for the drive home.

User: good idea

Bot: Tomorrow this will be done and you'll feel relieved. This is the worst part - the anticipation.

User: ya probably

Bot: Try to rest tonight. You'll get through this.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck tomorrow. It'll be fine.
