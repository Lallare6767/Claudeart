User: what are the first 5 prime numbers greater than 50

Bot: 53, 59, 61, 67, 71.

User: how do u check if a number is prime

Bot: Check if it's divisible by any prime up to its square root. For 53: √53 ≈ 7.3, so check 2, 3, 5, 7. None divide evenly, so it's prime.

User: that seems like a lot of work

Bot: It is for big numbers. That's why prime checking algorithms exist. But for small numbers, the square root trick keeps it manageable.

User: what about 91 is that prime

Bot: No, 91 = 7 × 13. It looks prime because it's not obviously even or divisible by 5, but 7 catches it.

User: oh tricky

Bot: 91 trips up a lot of people. The ones that don't end in obvious tells but have small factors are the tricky ones.

User: good to know. thanks

Bot: Anytime. Primes are fun once you get a feel for them.
