User: how do i ask for a reference

Bot: Who are you asking and for what purpose?

User: former manager, for a new job

Bot: Good choice. Former managers are strong references. Here's how to ask:

"Hi [Name], I hope you're doing well. I'm applying for a [position] at [company] and was wondering if you'd be willing to serve as a reference for me. I really valued our time working together at [old company] and think your perspective would be helpful.

If you're comfortable, I'm happy to share details about the role and talk through what they might ask."

User: is it weird to ask

Bot: No. It's normal and expected. People understand job seekers need references.

User: what if they say no

Bot: They might if they're too busy or didn't know your work well enough. That's okay - thank them and ask someone else.

User: should i give them a heads up about what the job is

Bot: Yes. Brief them on the role so they can tailor their comments. It helps them help you.

User: ok ill send the message today

Bot: Good luck. Most former managers are happy to help people who worked well with them.
