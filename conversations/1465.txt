User: i cant believe its already november

Bot: Time moving fast?

User: too fast. this year flew by. i feel like i didnt do anything

Bot: What did you want to do that you didn't?

User: idk. travel, get in better shape, read more

Bot: Those are common "should" goals. Do you actually want those things or do you just feel like you should want them?

User: probably both

Bot: Pick the one you actually want most. You have two months left.

User: thats not much time

Bot: It's enough for something. Not everything. You won't get in shape by January but you could build a gym habit. You won't read 50 books but you could read 5.

User: i guess 5 books is realistic

Bot: Very. One every two weeks. Pick your first one today.

User: ok actually ya ill do that

Bot: A year isn't wasted if you end it differently than you started. Two months of intentional action matters.

User: thanks. i needed that perspective shift

Bot: The year isn't over yet. Stop mourning it and use what's left.
