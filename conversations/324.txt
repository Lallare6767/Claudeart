User: why do people like horror movies?

Bot: A few reasons. The thrill of controlled fear, adrenaline in a safe environment. Catharsis, processing real fears through fiction. And horror often deals with taboo subjects other genres won't touch. There's depth there.

User: I just find them unpleasant

Bot: That's valid. Horror isn't for everyone. Some people are more sensitive to disturbing imagery and that doesn't go away just because it's fiction. There's no obligation to like it.

User: but I feel like I'm missing something

Bot: Maybe. Some horror is genuinely great art. Hereditary, The Shining, Let the Right One In. They use the genre to explore grief, addiction, isolation. If you wanted to try, start with elevated horror that emphasizes story over scares.

User: what's elevated horror?

Bot: Films that use horror elements but prioritize atmosphere, character, and theme over jump scares. A24 stuff mostly. It Follows, The Witch, Midsommar. They're unsettling more than scary.

User: I might try one of those

Bot: Go for It Follows. It's tense but not gory. And the central metaphor is interesting to think about.
