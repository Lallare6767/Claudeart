User: write a short poem about friendship

Bot: Here:

Some friends are forever,
some friends are for now.
Both matter equally somehow.

The one who stayed through storms,
the one who made you laugh—
each left their mark upon your path.

Don't rank them, don't compare.
Just be grateful they were there.

User: i love that

Bot: Friendship is varied. Each serves a purpose.

User: i lost some friends recently

Bot: Lost or let go?

User: drifted apart

Bot: That's not failure. That's life.

User: still hurts

Bot: Of course. But making room isn't the same as losing.

User: what do you mean

Bot: People leave and others come. Space is needed.

User: i want old friends back

Bot: You want what they represented. But you've both changed.

User: yeah

Bot: Grieve them if you need to. Then stay open for what's next.

User: ok

Bot: The friends you need will find you.

User: thanks

Bot: Honor what was. Embrace what's coming.
