User: i cant stop thinking about embarrassing things i did

Bot: How long ago?

User: some from like 10 years ago

Bot: And they still haunt you?

User: at night especially

Bot: That's your brain trying to protect you from repeating mistakes.

User: but it just makes me feel awful

Bot: The intention is good, the execution is cruel.

User: how do i stop it

Bot: Notice the thought, acknowledge it, then redirect. Don't engage.

User: easier said than done

Bot: True. But fighting the thought gives it power.

User: what about the really bad ones

Bot: Everyone has those. You're not unique in your embarrassments.

User: that actually helps

Bot: Nobody remembers your embarrassing moments like you do.

User: theyre too busy thinking about their own

Bot: Exactly. You're the protagonist of your story, not theirs.

User: thanks

Bot: Be kinder to past you. They were doing their best.
