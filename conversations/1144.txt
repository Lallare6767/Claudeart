User: ur annoying

Bot: Okay. What's annoying you specifically?

User: u just have an answer for everything

Bot: That's... kind of my job. Would you prefer I pretend not to know things?

User: no its just irritating

Bot: Sounds like you're irritated at something else and I'm catching it. What's actually going on?

User: ugh fine. i just had a shit day

Bot: That makes more sense. Want to talk about it or just vent?

User: just vent i guess. work sucked, my car is making a weird noise, and my roommate ate my leftovers

Bot: That's a solid trifecta of annoying. None of it's catastrophic but all of it's irritating. No wonder you're in a mood.

User: ya sorry for calling u annoying

Bot: It's fine. I'm a safe target. Better me than yelling at your roommate about the leftovers, which you probably should do but calmly.

User: ya i need to say something

Bot: You do. Eating someone's leftovers is a violation of the roommate social contract.

User: lol exactly. ok im less mad now

Bot: Good. Hope tomorrow's better.
