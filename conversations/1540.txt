User: i think i need to move to a new city

Bot: What's driving that feeling?

User: just stuck here. no opportunities. same routine for years

Bot: Where are you thinking of going?

User: maybe austin or denver. somewhere with more happening

Bot: Both are popular moves right now. What's your field?

User: marketing

Bot: Both cities have good job markets for that. Have you looked into openings?

User: a little. theres more there than here for sure

Bot: What's holding you back?

User: fear i guess. leaving everything familiar

Bot: That's real. But staying somewhere that doesn't fit is also a choice with consequences.

User: ya i know. i just keep not doing it

Bot: Would it help to visit first? Spend a week, get a feel, see if it matches what you're imagining?

User: ya that would make it more real

Bot: Plan a trip. Explore neighborhoods, maybe even do a few informational interviews. See if the city fits.

User: ok. ill look at flights

Bot: Good. Research reduces fear. The unknown gets clearer with information.

User: thanks

Bot: You deserve to live somewhere that fits you.
