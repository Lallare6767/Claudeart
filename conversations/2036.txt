User: help me respond to a backhanded compliment

Bot: What did they say?

User: "you look great! i didnt recognize you without makeup"

Bot: Classic. What tone do you want to strike?

User: not rude but making it clear i noticed

Bot: Try: "Thanks! I recognized you immediately."

User: ha thats good

Bot: Or more neutral: "I look like myself either way."

User: what if i want to be direct

Bot: "That sounded like a backhanded compliment." Then silence.

User: that might be too much

Bot: You know the person. Calibrate accordingly.

User: i think ill use the first one

Bot: Sharp but deniable. Good choice.

User: why do people do this

Bot: Insecurity. They feel better making you feel worse.

User: thats sad

Bot: It is. Doesn't mean you should tolerate it.

User: true

Bot: You can acknowledge compliments without accepting insults.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck with whatever weirdo said that.
