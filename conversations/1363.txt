User: this is so annoying

Bot: What's going on?

User: my roommate keeps eating my food even tho i label it

Bot: That's a basic respect issue. Have you talked to them about it?

User: ya multiple times. they say sorry then do it again

Bot: Then the apologies are meaningless. At this point it's not forgetfulness - it's disregard.

User: exactly! like how hard is it to not eat food that has my name on it

Bot: It's not hard. They're choosing convenience over your boundary. What's stopping you from getting a mini fridge for your room?

User: shouldnt have to spend money bc theyre inconsiderate

Bot: You shouldn't have to. But you can't force them to change, only control your own situation. Sometimes the practical solution beats the fair one.

User: ugh i hate that ur right

Bot: Sometimes being right doesn't feel good. But a $100 mini fridge might save you more than that in stolen groceries.

User: fine ill look into it

Bot: And maybe start looking for a better roommate situation for next lease.
