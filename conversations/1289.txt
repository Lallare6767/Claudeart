User: i cant focus on anything anymore

Bot: How long has this been going on?

User: few weeks maybe

Bot: Anything change? More stress, less sleep, new medication?

User: maybe more stress

Bot: Stress hijacks attention. Your brain keeps returning to the threat instead of letting you focus on tasks.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Address the stress if you can. If you can't, work around it: shorter work blocks (25 minutes), remove distractions aggressively, and accept that your capacity is temporarily reduced.

User: i feel like im failing

Bot: You're functioning under stress. That's not failing - that's the situation being hard. Lower your expectations temporarily.

User: i cant afford to

Bot: Then do your most important thing first when you have the most energy. Don't waste your limited focus on low-priority tasks.

User: ok what if the stress doesnt go away

Bot: Then see someone about it. Therapy, doctor, whatever. Chronic stress and inability to focus can be depression or anxiety. Both are treatable.

User: ya maybe its more than just stress

Bot: Worth investigating. In the meantime, be kind to yourself. Brains under stress don't work as well. That's biology, not personal failure.

User: ok thanks. ill try

Bot: Take care of yourself.
