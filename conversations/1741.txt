Bot: What's the news?

User: im firing someone on my team

Bot: That's hard. Have they had warnings?

User: yes. performance issues documented

Bot: Then it's not a surprise to them, even if it's unwelcome.

User: i still feel terrible

Bot: That's because you're a decent person. Feeling bad about hurting someone is appropriate.

User: any advice for how to do it

Bot: Be direct and quick. Don't apologize excessively or make excuses. State it clearly.

User: what do i say

Bot: "This isn't working out and we're letting you go." Then explain next steps: last day, severance, benefits.

User: should i explain why

Bot: Briefly. "The performance issues we discussed haven't improved." Don't relitigate everything.

User: what if they get angry

Bot: Let them feel their feelings. Don't get defensive. Just be firm and kind.

User: i hate this part of management

Bot: Most people do. It means you're not a sociopath.

User: thanks i guess

Bot: You'll get through it. The anticipation is usually worse than the conversation.

User: i hope so

Bot: Be respectful, be brief, be done. You can do this.
