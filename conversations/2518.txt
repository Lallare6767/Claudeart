User: how do i graph a linear equation

Bot: Find two points. Plot them. Draw line through.

User: how do i find points

Bot: Plug in x values. Get y. For y = 2x + 1, if x = 0, y = 1.

User: so (0, 1)

Bot: That's the y-intercept. Now find another.

User: x = 2. y = 2(2) + 1 = 5. so (2, 5)

Bot: Plot both. Connect with straight line.

User: can i use slope too

Bot: Yes. Start at y-intercept. Use slope to find next point.

User: slope is 2 so up 2 right 1

Bot: Up 2, right 1 from (0, 1) gives (1, 3). Then (2, 5). Same line.

User: both methods work

Bot: Yes. Intercept + slope is often faster.

User: what if equation isnt in slope form

Bot: Convert it or find intercepts. Set x = 0 for y-intercept. Set y = 0 for x-intercept.

User: example

Bot: 2x + 3y = 6. x = 0: y = 2. y = 0: x = 3. Points (0, 2) and (3, 0).

User: thats clever

Bot: Intercepts are easy to find. Good for graphing.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice graphing several. Visual connection to equations is powerful.
