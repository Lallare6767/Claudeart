Bot: When do you do it?

User: when they get close

Bot: What does close feel like?

User: vulnerable. exposed

Bot: So you push away to protect yourself?

User: i guess

Bot: From what specifically?

User: them hurting me. leaving

Bot: If you push them away, they leave anyway.

User: but on my terms

Bot: Does that actually feel better?

User: no

Bot: Then you're guaranteeing the outcome you fear.

User: i know its not logical

Bot: It's very logical for self-protection. Just counterproductive.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Notice the urge to push. Pause. Choose differently.

User: what if they do hurt me

Bot: They might. Intimacy requires risk.

User: thats terrifying

Bot: Yes. But the alternative is guaranteed loneliness.

User: ok

Bot: Start small. Let someone slightly closer. See what happens.

User: ok ill try

Bot: You're worth the risk of knowing.
