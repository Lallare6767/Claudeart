User: can u settle an argument

Bot: Maybe. What's the argument?

User: is a hot dog a sandwich

Bot: What's your position?

User: i say no. my friend says yes

Bot: Define sandwich.

User: bread with stuff between it

Bot: A hot dog bun is bread. The hot dog is stuff between it.

User: but its not between. the bread is on the sides

Bot: Submarine sandwiches have bread on the sides too.

User: ok but is it a sandwich

Bot: By structure, arguably yes. By cultural category, no.

User: cultural category?

Bot: We don't call it a sandwich. That matters. Language is usage.

User: so technically yes but actually no?

Bot: Correct. It's sandwich-shaped but not sandwich-named.

User: that doesnt settle it

Bot: Most arguments like this can't be settled. They're about definition, not facts.

User: my friend will say i lost

Bot: Tell them the question is the problem, not the answer.

User: lol ok

Bot: Hot dogs exist in a liminal sandwich space. Peace with ambiguity.
