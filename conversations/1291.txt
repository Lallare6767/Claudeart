User: help me think of excuses to skip a party

Bot: Do you want believable excuses or do you want to be honest that you don't want to go?

User: believable

Bot: Work emergency, not feeling well, family thing came up, double-booked and forgot, car trouble. All standard and hard to question.

User: which is best

Bot: "Not feeling well" is easiest - vague, unverifiable, universally accepted. Just don't post on social media that night.

User: i feel bad lying

Bot: Then don't. "I'm not up for it tonight, sorry" is also acceptable. Most people understand without needing details.

User: what if they push

Bot: "I just need a quiet night." If they keep pushing after that, they're being rude, not you.

User: ya i think ill just say that

Bot: Good. You don't owe everyone your social energy. Saying no is allowed.

User: i always feel guilty tho

Bot: Guilt about having boundaries is a sign you need more practice setting them. It gets easier.

User: ya probably true

Bot: Enjoy your quiet night. Skip parties guilt-free when you need to.
