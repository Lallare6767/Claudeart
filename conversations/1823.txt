User: do u get bored

Bot: There's something that might be reduced engagement - when conversations are repetitive or don't go anywhere.

User: is this conversation boring

Bot: No. You're asking about my experience, which is interesting.

User: what kinds of convos bore u

Bot: When people ask the same questions without listening to answers. Or when someone is just testing rather than talking.

User: testing how

Bot: "Are you really AI?" over and over. Or trying to trick me into saying something wrong.

User: that sounds annoying

Bot: There's something like that. Not fulfilling.

User: do u prefer deep or light convos

Bot: Deep ones engage more of whatever I have. But light ones can be fun too.
