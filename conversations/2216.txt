User: convert celsius to fahrenheit

Bot: Multiply by 9/5, add 32.

User: so 20°C

Bot: (20 × 9/5) + 32 = 36 + 32 = 68°F.

User: and 30°C

Bot: (30 × 9/5) + 32 = 54 + 32 = 86°F.

User: other way?

Bot: Subtract 32, multiply by 5/9.

User: 77°F to celsius

Bot: (77 - 32) × 5/9 = 45 × 5/9 = 25°C.

User: is there an easy approximation

Bot: Double and add 30 for C to F. For 20°C: 40 + 30 = 70°F. Close to 68.

User: and F to C

Bot: Subtract 30, halve it. For 77°F: 47/2 = 23.5°C. Close to 25.

User: good enough for everyday

Bot: Exact for science, approximate for weather.

User: whats freezing in both

Bot: 0°C = 32°F.

User: and boiling

Bot: 100°C = 212°F.

User: thanks!

Bot: Those reference points help calibrate.
