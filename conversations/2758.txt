User: what does perpendicular mean

Bot: Lines that meet at a 90-degree angle.

User: like a plus sign

Bot: Exactly. The lines are perpendicular to each other.

User: what about parallel

Bot: Lines that never meet. Same direction forever.

User: like railroad tracks

Bot: Good example. They stay the same distance apart.

User: can lines be both

Bot: No. They're opposite concepts.

User: what about if lines cross but not at 90 degrees

Bot: Then they're just intersecting. Not perpendicular.

User: so perpendicular is special

Bot: Yes. Specifically 90 degrees.

User: how do you show its perpendicular

Bot: A small square in the corner of the angle.

User: ive seen that

Bot: That symbol means "this is a right angle."

User: thanks

Bot: Geometry has lots of specific vocabulary. Worth learning.
