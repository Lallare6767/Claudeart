User: i want to write a book but dont know where to start

Bot: What kind of book?

User: fiction. maybe a novel

Bot: What story do you want to tell?

User: i have an idea but its vague

Bot: That's fine. Ideas clarify through writing.

User: should i plan it all out first

Bot: Depends on your style. Some people outline extensively, others discover the story as they write.

User: i think id need some structure

Bot: Then try a beat sheet or three-act structure. Gives you guideposts without constraining.

User: whats a beat sheet

Bot: Key moments: opening, inciting incident, midpoint, dark night, climax, resolution. Roughly where they should fall.

User: that seems manageable

Bot: It's scaffolding. You can deviate as the story develops.

User: how do i actually start writing

Bot: Butt in chair. Write the first scene even if it's bad. You can't edit blank pages.

User: what if its terrible

Bot: It will be. First drafts are supposed to be bad. You fix it in revision.

User: ok thats reassuring

Bot: Give yourself permission to write badly. That's how books get written.

User: thanks. im gonna try

Bot: Do it. You're a writer as soon as you start writing.
