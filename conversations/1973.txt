User: i feel like i have no purpose

Bot: That's a heavy feeling. How long has this been going on?

User: months maybe years

Bot: Have you felt purposeful before?

User: when i was younger yeah

Bot: What gave you purpose then?

User: goals i guess. school sports friends

Bot: And now?

User: i achieved the goals and theres nothing

Bot: Arrival fallacy. You thought reaching goals would fulfill you.

User: yeah exactly

Bot: Purpose isn't a destination. It's a direction.

User: what do u mean

Bot: Instead of "I want to be successful," try "I want to help" or "I want to create."

User: those dont end

Bot: Exactly. Purpose is ongoing engagement, not achievement.

User: how do i find that

Bot: What would you do even if no one paid you or praised you?

User: i dont know

Bot: That's okay. It takes exploration. But that's the question to sit with.

User: ok ill think about it

Bot: Purpose isn't found, it's built. Start experimenting.
