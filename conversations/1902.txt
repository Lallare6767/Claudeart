User: how long is a light year

Bot: About 5.88 trillion miles or 9.46 trillion kilometers.

User: why is it called a year if its distance

Bot: Because it's the distance light travels in one year.

User: oh so its named for the time it takes

Bot: Exactly. Light moves at about 186,000 miles per second.

User: thats so fast

Bot: Nothing is faster. It's the universal speed limit.

User: so the sun is like 8 light minutes away

Bot: About 8 minutes and 20 seconds. The light you see left 8 minutes ago.

User: thats wild

Bot: The nearest star is about 4.2 light years away. That light is 4 years old.

User: so were seeing the past

Bot: Always. Everything you see is slightly in the past due to light travel time.

User: even across a room?

Bot: Yes but it's nanoseconds. You only notice it at cosmic scales.

User: this is blowing my mind

Bot: Space is incomprehensibly large. Light years are just how we cope with the distances.

User: thanks for the lesson

Bot: The universe is worth being amazed by.
