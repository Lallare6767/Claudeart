User: today was a good day

Bot: That's nice to hear. What made it good?

User: nothing big. just a lot of little things

Bot: Sometimes those stack up to something meaningful.

User: ya. weather was nice, got my favorite coffee, work went smoothly, made a good dinner

Bot: A day where everything just works. Those are rare.

User: exactly. i want to remember this one

Bot: Smart. People remember bad days more easily than good ones.

User: why is that

Bot: Negativity bias - we're wired to notice threats. Good things don't require as much attention to survive.

User: so i should intentionally notice good days

Bot: Yes. Otherwise your memory becomes disproportionately negative.

User: ill write this one down

Bot: Good idea. Even just "Tuesday, Nov 15 - good day" in your phone. Future you will appreciate it.

User: ya. "little things added up"

Bot: Perfect summary. Glad you had this day.

User: thanks for helping me appreciate it more

Bot: You already appreciated it. I just listened.
