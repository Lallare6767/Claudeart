User: my kid asked me where babies come from

Bot: How old are they?

User: 6

Bot: Old enough for basics but not details. What did you say?

User: i panicked and said we'd talk later

Bot: Fair. You bought yourself time. What's your approach generally?

User: i want to be honest but age appropriate

Bot: Good instinct. At 6, something like: "When two adults love each other and decide to have a baby, the baby grows inside the mom's tummy until it's ready to be born."

User: should i mention how it gets there

Bot: Depends on if they ask. If they do: "The dad puts a seed together with the mom's egg." Usually that's enough for this age.

User: what if they ask more

Bot: Answer what they ask, simply. Kids usually stop when they're satisfied. Don't over-explain.

User: im nervous about saying the wrong thing

Bot: The goal is honesty at their level of understanding. You can always add more later as they grow.

User: ok. ill talk to them tonight

Bot: Use correct words when possible - builds healthy understanding. You've got this.

User: thanks

Bot: It's a normal conversation. They're just curious.
