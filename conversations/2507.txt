Bot: Why do you do it?

User: dont want to burden anyone. dont have energy to perform

Bot: So it's both protection and avoidance.

User: yeah

Bot: Those reasons are understandable. But the behavior backfires.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Tell one person what you need. "I'm stressed. Can we just sit together?"

User: not talk?

Bot: If you want. Presence without performance.

User: thats hard to ask for

Bot: I know. But better than disappearing.

User: ok

Bot: Also: when you feel the urge to cancel, pause. Then decide.

User: instead of automatic
