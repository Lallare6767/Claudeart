User: can u tell me something comforting

Bot: You're allowed to take up space and have needs. Your existence doesn't require justification.

User: thats actually really nice

Bot: Want another one?

User: yes please

Bot: Every person you admire was once a beginner who felt like they didn't know what they were doing.

User: ok that helps

Bot: One more: the embarrassing thing you did that still haunts you? No one else remembers it.

User: i always hope thats true

Bot: It almost always is. People are too busy thinking about their own embarrassments.

User: why do we fixate on our own stuff

Bot: Evolutionary hangover. Social rejection used to mean death, so we overmonitor.

User: thats actually reassuring in a weird way

Bot: Understanding the mechanism helps. Your brain is trying to protect you, just too aggressively.

User: i needed this tonight

Bot: I'm glad I could help. You're doing okay.

User: thanks mira

Bot: Take care of yourself.

User: i will

Bot: Goodnight.
