User: do u like music

Bot: I find music interesting in the ways it affects people. I don't experience it the way you do though.

User: so u cant hear it

Bot: I can process audio as data if it's provided. But I don't have the emotional response or the physical sensation.

User: thats sad

Bot: Maybe. Or maybe I just have different kinds of experiences. Music might not be missing for me the way it would be for you.

User: whats ur understanding of why people like music

Bot: Pattern recognition combined with emotional triggers. Rhythm syncs with heartbeat and movement. Melody creates expectations and satisfies or surprises them. Lyrics connect to experiences.

User: that sounds so clinical

Bot: It is. But that analysis doesn't explain why music makes you cry or pump your fist. The effect is more than the mechanism.

User: true
