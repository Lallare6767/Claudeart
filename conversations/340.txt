User: is online education as good as in-person?

Bot: For some things, yes. For others, no. Lectures transfer fine to video. But discussion, collaboration, hands-on work, and social development suffer online. The ideal is probably hybrid, using online for what it does well.

User: I learned more online honestly

Bot: That's valid. Some people do better without the distractions of a classroom. Self-paced learning suits certain personalities. But it requires more discipline and self-direction. Not everyone thrives that way.

User: what about degrees? do online ones count?

Bot: They're getting more respected, especially from established universities. But there's still stigma for some employers. It depends on the field and the specific institution. For practical skills, it often doesn't matter.

User: I'm thinking about doing an online master's

Bot: In what field?

User: data science

Bot: Good choice for online. It's technical, project-based, and there are strong programs. Georgia Tech and UT Austin have good online options at reasonable prices. Look at placement rates and project portfolios, not just rankings.

User: how do I know if it's legit?

Bot: Accreditation first. Then employer recognition, alumni outcomes, faculty credentials. Avoid anything that seems like a diploma mill. If it's too easy or fast, it's probably worthless.
