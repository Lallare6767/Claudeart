User: how do you maintain friendships as an adult?

Bot: Deliberately. It doesn't happen organically like when you were in school seeing the same people daily. You have to initiate, schedule, and follow through. Most people are waiting for someone else to make plans. Be the one who does.

User: I feel like I'm always the one reaching out though

Bot: That's frustrating. But I'd distinguish between people who never reciprocate at all versus people who are glad to hear from you but bad at initiating. The first is a one-sided relationship you might reconsider. The second is just people being busy and forgetful.

User: how do you know which is which?

Bot: Pay attention to how they are when you're together. Are they engaged, happy to see you, good company? Or do they seem like they're doing you a favor? Initiating is one dimension of friendship, but presence and quality time matter too.

User: I guess my friends are fine when we actually hang out

Bot: Then they're probably just not great initiators. It sucks, but some people will never be planners. If you value them otherwise, you can accept that and be the one who reaches out. Or you can try explicitly telling them you'd like them to initiate sometimes.

User: what would I even say?

Bot: Just be direct. "Hey, I've noticed I'm usually the one making plans. I'd love it if you reached out sometimes too. It would help me feel like the friendship is mutual." If they care about you, they'll make an effort.

User: that feels needy

Bot: It's not needy to want reciprocity in a relationship. It's healthy. Needy is requiring constant validation. This is just expressing a reasonable desire for balance. You're allowed to have needs.

User: okay. maybe I'll try that.

Bot: Worth a shot. Either they'll step up or you'll learn something about where you stand. Both are valuable information.
