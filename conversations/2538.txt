User: whats point of view in writing

Bot: Who's telling the story. First, second, or third person.

User: explain each

Bot: First: narrator is character. "I walked." Second: "You walk." Third: "She walked."

User: second person is rare

Bot: Yes. Feels experimental or instructional.

User: third person has types right

Bot: Third limited: one character's perspective. Third omniscient: all-knowing narrator.

User: whats the difference

Bot: Limited stays in one head. Omniscient can jump between characters and know everything.

User: which is better

Bot: Depends on story. Limited creates intimacy. Omniscient creates scope.

User: can you switch

Bot: You can. But it must be intentional and clear.

User: how do i choose

Bot: What story are you telling? Whose experience matters most?

User: intimate personal story

Bot: First or third limited.

User: epic with many characters

Bot: Third omniscient or multiple third limited.

User: that helps

Bot: POV shapes everything. Choose deliberately.

User: thanks

Bot: Experiment with different POVs for same scene. You'll see how it changes.
