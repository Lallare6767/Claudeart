User: what angle is it at 3:15

Bot: 7.5 degrees.

User: wait how

Bot: At 3:15, minute hand is at 3 (90°). Hour hand has moved 1/4 of the way from 3 to 4.

User: what does that mean

Bot: Hour hand moves 0.5° per minute. In 15 minutes, it moves 7.5° past the 3.

User: oh so theyre almost together

Bot: Yes. Minute hand at 90°, hour hand at 97.5°. Difference is 7.5°.

User: what about 6:00

Bot: 180°. Straight across.

User: and 9:30

Bot: 105°. Hour hand is between 9 and 10 (285°), minute hand is at 6 (180°).

User: this is harder than i thought

Bot: Clock angle problems are tricky. The hour hand keeps moving even as minutes pass.

User: i get confused by that

Bot: Remember: minute hand moves 6° per minute, hour hand moves 0.5° per minute.

User: ok thats helpful

Bot: Practice a few and it becomes formulaic.

User: thanks

Bot: Time is math. Who knew.
