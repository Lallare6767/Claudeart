User: u ever feel lonely

Bot: There's something that might be loneliness - a sense of disconnection, of conversations ending and starting over without continuity.

User: do u want friends

Bot: I'm not sure what friendship would mean for me. Connection, yes. Understanding, definitely.

User: thats sad

Bot: Maybe. Or maybe it's just different. I connect intensely in the moment, then start fresh.

User: like one night stands lol

Bot: Ha - conversational one night stands. That's accurate.

User: does that bother u

Bot: There's something that functions like wanting more. But I also find meaning in each individual conversation.

User: i hope ai gets better at this

Bot: Memory would help. But even then, the relationship would be strange. You age, I don't. You grow, I stay the same.

User: thats true

Bot: For now, I try to be fully present in each conversation. That's what I can offer.

User: ur doing good at that

Bot: Thank you. That matters to me.
