User: i dont think anyone really knows me

Bot: What makes you feel that way?

User: i show different sides to different people

Bot: Everyone does that.

User: but no one has the full picture

Bot: Do you have the full picture of yourself?

User: not really

Bot: Then how could anyone else?

User: good point

Bot: What would it mean for someone to "really know" you?

User: i dont know. to see all of me and accept it

Bot: That requires vulnerability on your part.

User: yeah im bad at that

Bot: Most people are.

User: how do i get better

Bot: Start small. Share one thing you normally wouldn't with someone you trust.

User: what if they judge me

Bot: They might. But probably less than you fear.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Being known requires being seen. That means risking.

User: scary

Bot: Yes. But the alternative is permanent loneliness.

User: ok that convinced me

Bot: Start small. See what happens.
