User: how do i stop being a perfectionist

Bot: What does perfectionism cost you?

User: everything takes forever. i never finish things

Bot: Then perfectionism isn't helping. It's sabotaging.

User: i know but i cant help it

Bot: You can. It just takes practice.

User: how

Bot: Set time limits. Whatever you have at the end is what you submit.

User: but it wont be good enough

Bot: Good enough for what? Most things don't need to be perfect.

User: they do to me

Bot: That's the lie perfectionism tells you.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Done is better than perfect. Practice finishing imperfect things.

User: on purpose?

Bot: Yes. Send an email with a typo. Turn in B+ work.

User: that sounds awful

Bot: It is at first. Then it's freeing.

User: ok

Bot: Perfectionism comes from fear. Face the fear directly.

User: fear of what

Bot: Judgment. Failure. Being seen as inadequate.

User: yeah

Bot: You're already judging yourself. Why give others that power too?

User: ok ill try

Bot: Start small. One imperfect thing this week.
