User: simplify √50 + √18

Bot: 8√2.

User: show me how

Bot: √50 = √(25×2) = 5√2. √18 = √(9×2) = 3√2. Add: 5√2 + 3√2 = 8√2.

User: oh so u can add them because they have the same radical part

Bot: Exactly! Like adding 5x + 3x = 8x.

User: what about √12 + √27

Bot: √12 = 2√3. √27 = 3√3. Total: 5√3.

User: got it. what about √8 + √32

Bot: 2√2 + 4√2 = 6√2.

User: this is actually easy once u simplify first

Bot: That's the key insight. Simplify, then combine like terms.

User: what if they have different insides

Bot: Like √2 + √3? They can't be combined. Different radical parts.

User: so its just √2 + √3

Bot: Yes. Unlike terms stay separated.

User: thanks for the practice

Bot: Radicals follow the same rules as variables. Once you see it, it's natural.

User: i see it now

Bot: Good! Keep simplifying.
