User: sometimes i feel like im performing being happy

Bot: Performing for who?

User: everyone. friends, coworkers, family

Bot: What would happen if you stopped?

User: people would worry. ask questions

Bot: Is that the actual fear or is there something else?

User: maybe theyd see im not ok

Bot: And what would that mean?

User: i dont know. vulnerability. pity

Bot: So the performance protects you from being seen.

User: i guess

Bot: That's exhausting. Maintaining a mask is full-time work.

User: it really is

Bot: Is there even one person you can be real with?

User: not really

Bot: That's lonelier than being alone with people who don't know you.

User: yeah

Bot: You don't have to broadcast your struggles. But one person who knows helps.

User: i wouldnt know where to start

Bot: Start small. Tell one person one true thing about how you're doing.

User: that feels huge

Bot: It is. And it's important. The mask is hurting you.

User: ok ill think about it

Bot: The real you deserves to be seen too.

User: thanks

Bot: Take care of yourself.
