User: i feel guilty all the time

Bot: About what?

User: everything. working too much. not working enough. relaxing

Bot: That's exhausting.

User: it is

Bot: Where does the guilt come from?

User: i dont know. always been this way

Bot: Did someone make you feel like nothing was ever enough?

User: my parents probably

Bot: So you internalized an impossible standard.

User: i guess

Bot: Is there anything you can do that doesn't produce guilt?

User: not really

Bot: Then the guilt isn't about actions. It's about you.

User: what do u mean

Bot: You feel guilty for existing. That's the real issue.

User: thats heavy

Bot: It is. And it's worth exploring with a therapist.

User: ok

Bot: You're allowed to exist without earning it.

User: i dont believe that

Bot: I know. But maybe someday you will.

User: i hope so

Bot: Start by noticing the guilt without obeying it.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You deserve to feel okay. Even doing nothing.
