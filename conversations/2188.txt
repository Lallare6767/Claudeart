User: i keep having the same fight with my partner

Bot: About what?

User: chores

Bot: What specifically?

User: i do more and they dont see it

Bot: Have you talked about division of labor?

User: many times

Bot: And?

User: they agree then nothing changes

Bot: So words without action.

User: exactly

Bot: That's not a chore problem. That's a respect problem.

User: what do u mean

Bot: They're agreeing to appease you, not because they'll change.

User: maybe

Bot: Or they genuinely don't notice. Have you tried visible systems?

User: like what

Bot: Chore charts. Shared apps. Makes invisible work visible.

User: feels childish

Bot: So does repeating the same fight.

User: fair

Bot: If they still don't change with visible systems, then it's willful.

User: then what

Bot: Bigger conversation about whether this relationship works for you.

User: ok

Bot: Try the systems first. Give it a real chance.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You deserve a partner, not another dependent.
