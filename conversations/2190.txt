User: im overthinking a text

Bot: From whom?

User: someone im interested in

Bot: What did they say?

User: ok with a period

Bot: And you're analyzing the period.

User: yes is that bad

Bot: Depends. What did you say before?

User: asked if they wanted to hang out

Bot: And they said "ok."

User: with a period

Bot: "Ok." is different from "ok!" or "ok" or "OK!!"

User: exactly

Bot: You're not wrong that punctuation has meaning.

User: so its bad

Bot: Not necessarily. Some people just type formally.

User: what do i do

Bot: Respond normally. "Great, how's Saturday?"

User: and watch for more signals

Bot: Yes. One text isn't data. A pattern is.

User: ok

Bot: Also: you can't control how they feel. Just respond authentically.

User: youre right

Bot: And if "ok." is their enthusiasm level, that's information too.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Good luck. Try not to spiral.

User: ill try

Bot: It's just a text. Breathe.
