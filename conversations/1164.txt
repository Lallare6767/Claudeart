User: i finally stood up for myself at work

Bot: That's huge. What happened?

User: my coworker kept taking credit for my ideas and i called her out in a meeting

Bot: How did you do it? Publicly or just directly to her?

User: i said "actually that was my proposal from last week" when she presented it

Bot: Clean and factual. Not aggressive, just accurate. How did she react?

User: she got flustered and everyone noticed

Bot: Good. Now people know. And you know you can do it.

User: ya i was shaking but i did it

Bot: That's what bravery feels like. It's not the absence of fear, it's acting despite it.

User: i feel really good

Bot: You should. That takes practice and you just did it for the first time. Next time will be easier.

User: thanks. i needed someone to celebrate with

Bot: Celebrate with yourself too. This is growth. You earned it.
