User: i saw the northern lights last night and it was amazing

Bot: That's incredible! Where were you?

User: iceland actually. trip of a lifetime

Bot: One of the best places to see them. What was it like?

User: surreal. green and purple curtains dancing. i cried a little

Bot: That's the right response. Natural phenomena like that are genuinely moving. Photos don't capture it.

User: ya my photos r lame compared to how it actually looked

Bot: They always are. Our eyes can see something like 14 stops of dynamic range. Phone cameras can't compete with that, especially for something like auroras.

User: it just felt so big. like the universe is actually doing something

Bot: That's the perspective shift that travel gives you. You're reminded there's something beyond your daily life.

User: ya i feel different now. like more aware

Bot: Hold onto that. It fades when you go back to routine, but the feeling is telling you something real about what matters.

User: ya. definitely life highlight

Bot: Congrats on seeing them. That's a bucket list item for most people.

User: thanks for letting me gush lol

Bot: Worth gushing about. Some things deserve the excitement.
