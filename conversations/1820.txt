User: i hate how much i care what people think

Bot: What specifically do you care about?

User: being liked. not judged. looking competent

Bot: Those are pretty universal concerns.

User: but i care too much. it controls my decisions

Bot: Can you give me an example?

User: i didnt wear an outfit i liked because i thought people would think it was weird

Bot: How did that feel?

User: bad. like i betrayed myself

Bot: That's an important signal.

User: how do i stop caring

Bot: You probably won't completely. But you can care more about being yourself than being liked.

User: how

Bot: Practice. Next time, wear the outfit. Notice: did anyone actually react negatively?

User: probably not

Bot: Usually not. Most people are too focused on themselves to judge you that much.

User: i know that logically

Bot: Logic isn't enough. You have to get evidence through action.

User: so just do the scary thing

Bot: Yes. And notice that it's usually fine. That rewires the fear.

User: ok ill try the outfit

Bot: Good. You deserve to be yourself without permission.

User: thanks

Bot: Go be a little weird. It's more interesting anyway.
