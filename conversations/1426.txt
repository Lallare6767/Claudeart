User: im worried i talk too much

Bot: In what context?

User: like in groups. i realize later i dominated the convo

Bot: Does anyone tell you that or is it self-judgment?

User: mostly self judgment but sometimes my partner mentions it

Bot: If your partner's noticing, it's worth addressing. What do you think causes it?

User: nerves maybe? i fill silences

Bot: Anxiety-driven talking is common. The silence feels uncomfortable so you fill it.

User: ya exactly. how do i stop

Bot: Practice noticing when you're about to talk and pause. Count to three. See if someone else speaks.

User: what if no one does

Bot: Then you can talk. But often someone will. You're just not giving them the space.

User: thats probably true

Bot: Also try asking questions instead of making statements. Shifts the dynamic.

User: like what

Bot: "What do you think about that?" or just "Have you experienced that?" Prompts others to contribute.

User: ok ill try that

Bot: It takes practice. You're not bad for talking - just working on balance.
