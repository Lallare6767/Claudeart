User: im angry at my friend but i dont know if its justified

Bot: What happened?

User: they cancelled plans last minute. again. third time this month

Bot: Have they given reasons?

User: always something. work emergency, not feeling well, forgot about another commitment

Bot: Do you believe them?

User: i used to. now im not sure

Bot: Either they're having a genuinely hard time or they're deprioritizing you. Both require conversation.

User: i dont want to be that person who gets upset about cancellations

Bot: Three times in a month is a pattern. It's reasonable to address.

User: what do i say

Bot: "Hey, I've noticed we've had to cancel plans a lot lately. Is everything okay with you? I miss hanging out."

User: so ask if theyre ok instead of accusing them

Bot: Exactly. Opens the door without putting them on defense. If everything's fine then you can express how the cancellations affect you.

User: ok ill try that

Bot: You're allowed to have needs in friendships. Not everything needs to be chill and unbothered.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck.
