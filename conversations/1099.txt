Bot: 99

User: what percent is 45 out of 180

Bot: 25%

User: ok last one: if something is 30% off and costs $42 after the discount, what was the original price

Bot: $60. If it's 30% off, you're paying 70%. So 42 = 0.70 × original. Original = 42/0.70 = 60.

User: oh that makes sense when u explain it

Bot: The trick is remembering that "percent off" means you're paying the remaining percent. 30% off = paying 70%.

User: i always mess that up

Bot: Common mistake. Just flip it in your head: 30% off → 70% on.

User: that actually helps thanks

Bot: Anytime. Percentages are just fractions in disguise - once you see it that way, they're less scary.
