User: how do i find perimeter

Bot: Add all the sides.

User: so rectangle 5 by 3

Bot: 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 16. Or 2(5+3) = 16.

User: and square with side 4

Bot: 4 × 4 = 16.

User: triangle 3 4 5

Bot: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

User: whats the difference between perimeter and area

Bot: Perimeter is around. Area is inside.

User: so perimeter is one dimensional and area is two

Bot: Exactly. Perimeter in units. Area in square units.

User: what about irregular shapes

Bot: Still add all sides. Just more of them.

User: and circles

Bot: Circumference instead of perimeter. C = 2πr.

User: same idea though

Bot: Yes. Distance around the edge.

User: when do i use perimeter in real life

Bot: Fencing. Baseboards. Frame for picture. Anything you wrap around.

User: makes sense

Bot: Area is filling in. Perimeter is going around.

User: thanks

Bot: Easy concept. Just measure and add.
