User: i miss who i used to be

Bot: In what way?

User: i used to be more fun. more social. more confident

Bot: When did that change?

User: gradually. maybe after college. work life beat it out of me

Bot: That's common. Adult responsibilities can flatten people.

User: how do i get it back

Bot: First - is it actually gone or just dormant?

User: i dont know

Bot: The person you were is still in there. You just stopped doing the things that brought that out.

User: so i need to do those things again

Bot: Yes. What made you feel fun and confident before?

User: going out. meeting people. being spontaneous

Bot: When's the last time you did any of that?

User: months. maybe longer

Bot: Then start there. Plan something spontaneous - contradictory but necessary.

User: like what

Bot: Text a friend right now. Ask them to do something this weekend.

User: that feels hard

Bot: I know. But you won't feel like yourself until you act like yourself.

User: ok. doing it

Bot: Good. That person isn't gone. They're just waiting for you to show up again.

User: thanks

Bot: Be the person you miss. They're still you.
