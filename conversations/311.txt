User: I have really low self-esteem

Bot: That's hard to live with. Do you know where it comes from?

User: I think from my parents criticizing everything I did

Bot: Internalized criticism is a common source. You heard those voices so much that they became your own. The challenge is recognizing when you're applying standards that aren't yours and weren't fair.

User: I compare myself to everyone

Bot: That's part of it too. Comparison is inherent to low self-esteem because your worth feels contingent on being better or worse than others. But you wouldn't compare an apple to an orange. You're just you.

User: I know that but I can't stop

Bot: It's a habit, and habits take time to change. When you notice the comparison, try to shift to noticing what you actually value about yourself. Not in comparison, just independently. It feels awkward at first.

User: I don't really value anything about myself

Bot: That's the low self-esteem talking. There are things. You probably just discount them. If a friend had your qualities, would you see value in them?

User: maybe

Bot: Then you can learn to see value in yourself. It's not easy. Therapy helps. But also just practicing self-compassion. Talking to yourself like you'd talk to a friend.

User: I'd never talk to a friend the way I talk to myself

Bot: Exactly. And you deserve the same kindness you'd give them.

User: thanks. this helped a little

Bot: Little helps add up. Keep working on it.
