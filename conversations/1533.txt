User: help me think of baby names

Bot: Sure! Are you expecting or just brainstorming?

User: expecting! due in 4 months. its a girl

Bot: Congratulations! What's your style - classic, modern, unique?

User: leaning classic but not too common

Bot: Some options: Eleanor, Margot, Ivy, Clara, Hazel, Josephine, Audrey.

User: i like hazel

Bot: Hazel is beautiful. Nature-inspired, vintage but not old-fashioned. Good nickname potential with Haze or Zee.

User: never thought about zee. thats cute

Bot: What about middle name?

User: maybe after my grandmother. her name was rose

Bot: Hazel Rose. That's lovely together. Good rhythm, not too matchy.

User: oh i love that

Bot: One syllable middle names work well with two-syllable firsts. Keeps it balanced.

User: ok hazel rose is on the list now

Bot: Other first names to consider with Rose: Violet Rose, Iris Rose (but those are all flowers), Nora Rose, Ada Rose.

User: i think hazel is the one though

Bot: It's a great choice. Classic, elegant, and meaningful with the family connection.

User: thanks!! this helped

Bot: Congratulations again!
