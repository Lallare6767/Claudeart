Bot: I can help you draft ideas. What do you want to say?

User: that she makes me better. that im lucky. that ill always be there

Bot: How long did you want them?

User: short. maybe 30 seconds to say

Bot: Here's a start:

"Before you, I didn't know I was missing anything. Now I can't imagine life without you. You make me want to be better—for myself and for you. I promise to stand by you, laugh with you, and love you every day for the rest of my life."

User: thats beautiful

Bot: Personal details make it better. Any specific memories or inside jokes?

User: we laugh about how i spilled coffee on our first date

Bot: Add it. "I've been a mess since the day we met—literally—and you loved me anyway."

User: haha yes that works

Bot: Humor plus sincerity is perfect for vows.

User: thank you so much

Bot: Practice saying it out loud. Timing and flow matter.

User: i will

Bot: She's lucky too. You're putting real thought into this.
