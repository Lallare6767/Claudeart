User: write me a poem about letting go

Bot: Here:

Hold on tight
then tighter still
until your fingers ache
and knuckles white.

Only then you'll learn
what holding costs—
not what you keep
but what you become.

Open your hands.
Watch it drift or fall.
You'll feel the loss
then feel the air.

Your palms are empty now
but also free
to catch what comes
or simply be.

User: wow

Bot: What are you trying to let go of?

User: someone

Bot: Hardest kind.

User: yeah

Bot: You don't have to let go all at once.

User: feels impossible

Bot: It's not. It just takes time and repetition.

User: thanks for the poem

Bot: Sometimes words help. Sometimes they just name the feeling.

User: this did both

Bot: Good. Use it when you need to.
