User: what are conjunctions

Bot: Words that connect clauses or sentences. And, but, or, so, yet.

User: examples in sentences

Bot: "I was tired but I kept going." But connects two independent clauses.

User: and commas?

Bot: Use comma before conjunction when joining independent clauses.

User: what about just words

Bot: "Apples and oranges." No comma. Joining words, not clauses.

User: oh thats why comma rules are confusing

Bot: The rule is based on what's being joined.

User: whats FANBOYS

Bot: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So. Coordinating conjunctions.

User: any others

Bot: Subordinating: because, although, if, when, while.

User: whats the difference

Bot: Coordinating joins equals. Subordinating makes one dependent.

User: example

Bot: "I left because I was tired." "Because I was tired" can't stand alone.

User: so the clause needs the other one

Bot: Right. Subordinating creates dependence.

User: this helps

Bot: Conjunctions are glue. They show how ideas relate.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice identifying them. They shape meaning.
