User: convert 32°F to celsius

Bot: 0°C. Freezing point.

User: how do u calculate it

Bot: C = (F - 32) × 5/9.

User: so 50°F

Bot: (50 - 32) × 5/9 = 18 × 5/9 = 10°C.

User: and 100°F

Bot: (100 - 32) × 5/9 = 68 × 5/9 ≈ 37.8°C.

User: body temperature is 98.6 right

Bot: Yes. That's 37°C.

User: what about celsius to fahrenheit

Bot: F = C × 9/5 + 32.

User: so 20°C

Bot: 20 × 9/5 + 32 = 36 + 32 = 68°F.

User: nice day

Bot: Exactly. Room temperature roughly.

User: -40 is the same in both right

Bot: Yes. The only temperature where they meet.

User: thats a fun fact

Bot: Math creates coincidences. That's one of them.

User: thanks this is helpful

Bot: Temperature conversion comes up often. Memorize 0°C = 32°F and 100°C = 212°F. Then calculate between.
