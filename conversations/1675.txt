User: i think i need to cut someone out of my life

Bot: What's the situation?

User: my friend is just constantly negative. drains me every time we hang out

Bot: Have you talked to them about it?

User: not directly no

Bot: Might be worth doing before cutting them off. They might not realize how they're affecting you.

User: but what if they get defensive

Bot: They might. But at least you tried. Right now you're making the decision without giving them a chance.

User: i guess thats fair

Bot: How would you want to be treated if you were unknowingly being a downer?

User: id want someone to tell me

Bot: Exactly. Give them the respect of honesty first.

User: what do i say

Bot: "I've noticed our hangouts leave me feeling drained. I value our friendship but I need our time together to feel better, not worse."

User: thats direct

Bot: It is. Direct is kind. Vague is confusing.

User: ok ill try that first

Bot: Good. If they can't hear it or won't change, then you have more information for your decision.

User: thanks for the perspective

Bot: Boundaries are healthy. Just make sure they know what boundary they're crossing.
