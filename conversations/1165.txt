User: give me a word that rhymes with orange

Bot: Nothing rhymes perfectly with orange in English. "Sporange" is the only technical rhyme - it's a botanical term for a part of a fern. But nothing in common usage.

User: thats so weird why not

Bot: English has some phonetic dead ends. Orange ends in a unique sound combination. Also purple, silver, and month have no perfect rhymes.

User: what about slant rhymes

Bot: For orange: "door hinge" is the famous one. Eminem used it. Also "porridge" or "storage" if you're loose with it.

User: door hinge is actually pretty good

Bot: It works if you deliver it right. Slant rhymes depend on flow and emphasis.

User: now im gonna think about rhymeless words all day

Bot: You're welcome. English is full of weird gaps like this. It's what happens when you smash three languages together and call it one.

User: lol true. thanks for the linguistics lesson

Bot: Anytime. Words are interesting.
