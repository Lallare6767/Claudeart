User: help me think through whether to move cities

Bot: What's pulling you toward moving and what's keeping you where you are?

User: job opportunity in new city. friends and family in current city

Bot: How good is the job opportunity? Life-changing or just better?

User: pretty big step up career wise

Bot: And how close are you to friends and family? Daily contact or occasional?

User: close but not daily. maybe weekly

Bot: How do you feel about your current city otherwise - cost of living, culture, things to do?

User: its fine. kinda bored honestly

Bot: Here's what I'm hearing: you have an opportunity for career growth in a new place, and some restlessness with where you are. The main thing holding you back is relationships.

User: ya thats pretty accurate

Bot: Those relationships can survive distance. You can visit, call, plan trips. It's not like old times where moving meant never seeing people again.

User: true but its not the same

Bot: It's not. But what's the alternative - stay bored and pass up a big opportunity to avoid discomfort? The relationships will adapt. Stagnation won't fix itself.

User: ya. i think i should probably go

Bot: Sounds like you already knew that. Sometimes you just need to hear yourself say it.
