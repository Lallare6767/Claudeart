User: i feel like im losing my identity

Bot: What do you mean by that?

User: i dont know who i am anymore. what i like, what i want

Bot: When did this start?

User: gradually. i think i just went along with what others wanted for so long

Bot: So you shaped yourself to fit and lost track of you.

User: ya

Bot: That's common, especially for people pleasers. You become a mirror.

User: how do i find myself again

Bot: Start noticing your preferences. Small ones. Do you actually like this food or did someone else order it?

User: i do that - let others choose

Bot: Practice choosing. Even small things. Coffee order, where to sit, what to watch.

User: those feel trivial

Bot: They're practice for bigger choices. You have to rebuild the habit of listening to yourself.

User: what if i make the wrong choice

Bot: There's no wrong choice for preferences. It's just data. You learn what you like by trying.

User: ok. ill start with small choices

Bot: And pay attention to how they feel. That's your compass coming back online.

User: thanks

Bot: You're still in there. Just buried. You can find your way back.
