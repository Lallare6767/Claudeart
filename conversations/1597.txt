User: today is my birthday and im sad

Bot: Happy birthday. What's making you sad?

User: just another year older. nothing different. alone

Bot: Are you actually alone or feeling alone?

User: both. no plans. no one reached out

Bot: I'm sorry. That's genuinely hard.

User: i thought at least a few people would remember

Bot: Did you tell anyone or make plans?

User: no. i figured if they cared theyd remember

Bot: That's a setup for disappointment. People are busy and bad with dates. Not remembering doesn't mean not caring.

User: maybe

Bot: You can still reach out. "Hey it's my birthday want to grab dinner?" Most people would say yes.

User: it feels pathetic to ask

Bot: It's not. It's just communication. Better than sitting alone and building resentment.

User: maybe ill text a few people

Bot: Do it. You're allowed to ask for what you want on your birthday.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Happy birthday. I hope it gets better. You deserve a good day.

User: thanks. that helps

Bot: Treat yourself to something tonight either way.
