User: my therapist said something that hurt

Bot: What did they say?

User: that i use intellectualization to avoid feeling

Bot: Did that feel true?

User: maybe. but it hurt to hear

Bot: Good therapy often does. Did you tell them?

User: no

Bot: Tell them next session. They need to know.

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: A good therapist won't. They'll explore it with you.

User: i want to quit

Bot: Because of this one comment?

User: and other things

Bot: Like what?

User: i dont feel like im making progress

Bot: Have you told them that either?

User: no

Bot: Therapy only works with honesty. About everything, including the therapy.

User: ok

Bot: Give them this feedback. See how they respond.

User: and if it doesn't help

Bot: Then consider finding someone else. Fit matters.

User: ok

Bot: Therapy should challenge you but also feel safe. Both matter.

User: thanks

Bot: Speak up next session. That's actually doing the work.
