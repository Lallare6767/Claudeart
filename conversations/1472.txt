Bot: Is it smaller than a tennis ball?

User: yes

Bot: Can it fit in a pocket?

User: ya

Bot: Is it electronic?

User: no

Bot: Is it something you'd find in a kitchen?

User: no

Bot: Is it made of metal?

User: partly

Bot: A key?

User: YES wow

Bot: Keys are common pocket items with partial metal. Once I ruled out electronics and kitchen items, it was likely a key, coin, or lighter.

User: why key over coin

Bot: You said "partly" metal, which suggests another material too. Keys have that plastic or rubber grip part often. Coins are fully metal.
