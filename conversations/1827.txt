Bot: Flow state. Not thinking, just being.

User: yeah exactly

Bot: That's worth cultivating. Activities that get you there.

User: how do i get there more

Bot: Notice what you were doing right before. Create those conditions intentionally.

User: usually im alone and not on my phone

Bot: There you go. Solitude without screens. Make time for that.

User: i feel guilty taking time like that

Bot: Why?

User: like i should be productive

Bot: Happiness is productive. It refills your capacity for everything else.

User: thats a good point
