User: what should i know before buying a house

Bot: A lot. The big ones: know your actual budget (not just what the bank approves you for), factor in all costs (taxes, insurance, maintenance, HOA), get a home inspection, and don't skip the boring parts like reading disclosures.

User: how much can i actually afford

Bot: Rule of thumb: 28% of gross income for housing costs, no more than 36% total debt. But more conservative is better - you want cushion for repairs and life changes.

User: whats the process like

Bot: Pre-approval, house hunting, offer, inspection, appraisal, closing. Takes 30-60 days typically from accepted offer to keys.

User: what do people regret most

Bot: Buying at the top of their budget, skipping inspection to win a bidding war, underestimating repair costs, and not considering the neighborhood long-term.

User: any hidden costs

Bot: Closing costs (2-5% of purchase price), property taxes, homeowners insurance, PMI if you put down less than 20%, HOA fees, and maintenance (budget 1% of home value annually).

User: thats a lot

Bot: Homeownership is expensive beyond the mortgage. Make sure you can afford all of it, not just the monthly payment.

User: maybe im not ready yet

Bot: That's fine. Better to wait than stretch too far. Keep saving and you'll be in a better position when you are ready.

User: ok thanks for the reality check

Bot: Good luck when you do pull the trigger.
