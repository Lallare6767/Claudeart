User: write me a limerick

Bot: There once was a coder named Drew
Whose bugs were not easy to view
He debugged through the night
Until morning's first light
And found it was just a typo or two.

User: lol thats great. one about cats

Bot: A cat with a plan quite complex
Would knock things off counters for checks
When owner said "no!"
The cat whispered "so?"
And proceeded to cause more wrecks.

User: my cat does that. one about mondays

Bot: On Monday the alarm starts to blare
You hit snooze with a groan of despair
The weekend seems far
You curse your alarm
And contemplate hiding under there.

User: too real. one more about pizza

Bot: A pizza with toppings galore
Said "I'm more than you've had before"
With cheese extra cheesy
It made eating easy
And soon you came back asking for more.

User: ur good at these

Bot: AABBA rhyme scheme. Bouncy rhythm. Punchline at end. That's the formula.

User: thanks for the laughs

Bot: Limericks are meant to be silly. Glad you enjoyed them.
