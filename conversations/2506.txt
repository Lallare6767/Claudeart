User: explain cross multiplication

Bot: Method for solving proportions. a/b = c/d becomes ad = bc.

User: example

Bot: x/4 = 3/6. Cross multiply: 6x = 12. x = 2.

User: let me try. 5/x = 10/14

Bot: Go ahead.

User: 5 × 14 = 10x. 70 = 10x. x = 7

Bot: Perfect. Check: 5/7 = 10/14. Simplify right: 5/7. Yes!

User: when do i use this

Bot: Comparing ratios. Scaling recipes. Similar triangles.

User: similar triangles?

Bot: Same shape different size. Corresponding sides are proportional.

User: oh so geometry uses it

Bot: A lot. Very practical.

User: what about 3/(x+1) = 6/8

Bot: Cross multiply.

User: 3 × 8 = 6(x+1). 24 = 6x + 6. 18 = 6x. x = 3

Bot: Check: 3/4 = 6/8. Simplify right: 3/4. Yes!

User: i like cross multiplication

Bot: It's reliable. Works for any proportion.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice more. Proportional thinking is useful everywhere.
