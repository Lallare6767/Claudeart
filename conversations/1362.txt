User: my grandpa died last night

Bot: I'm so sorry. That's a real loss. How are you holding up?

User: not great. we were close

Bot: Being close makes it hurt more. Is there anything specific you're struggling with right now?

User: just that i didnt get to say goodbye. he went suddenly

Bot: That's one of the hardest parts of sudden loss - the lack of closure. But if you were close, he knew how you felt about him.

User: i hope so

Bot: He did. Close relationships don't need final words to be understood. The relationship itself was the message.

User: i just keep thinking about all the things i wanted to tell him

Bot: Write them down. It won't bring him back but it can help you process. Some people find letters to the deceased genuinely helpful.

User: maybe ill try that

Bot: Take your time with grief. There's no right way to do this.

User: thanks for listening

Bot: Of course. I'm sorry for your loss.
