User: im so sick of social media but i feel like i have to be on it

Bot: Have to for what reason?

User: like to stay connected and know whats going on

Bot: You can stay connected without daily scrolling. Text people. Call them. Make plans. The feed isn't connection - it's surveillance.

User: but then i wont know whats happening in peoples lives

Bot: You'll know what they tell you directly, which is more real than what they post anyway. Feeds are curated highlight reels, not life.

User: what about FOMO

Bot: FOMO is manufactured by the platforms. They want you to feel like you're missing something. You're not. You're missing ads and other people's anxiety.

User: so i should just delete it

Bot: Try a break first. Two weeks off. See how you feel. Most people realize they miss it much less than they expected.

User: what if people forget about me

Bot: Then they weren't really in your life - they were in your feed. Real relationships survive without digital constant.

User: ok ill try the two week thing

Bot: Good. Notice how you feel after day 3, day 7, day 14. You might not want to go back.

User: here goes nothing

Bot: Good luck. Reclaim your attention.
