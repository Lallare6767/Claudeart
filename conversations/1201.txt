User: i just finished a really good book and im sad

Bot: The book hangover. What was the book?

User: it was fantasy, not even famous but the characters felt so real

Bot: That's the best kind. When you genuinely miss fictional people. What made them feel real?

User: they just had flaws and growth and i cared what happened to them

Bot: That's good writing. Making readers care is harder than plot or worldbuilding.

User: i dont want to start a new book bc itll feel like a betrayal

Bot: That's normal. Give yourself a day or two to sit with the feeling. Then start something very different - not a replacement, just a palate cleanser.

User: ya maybe nonfiction

Bot: Good idea. Totally different mode. You're not asking it to do what the other book did.

User: ive never felt this way about a book before

Bot: Then it gave you something valuable. That sadness is actually appreciation. You don't feel that way about things that don't matter.

User: ya thats a good way to see it

Bot: The feeling will fade but the book is in you now. That's the whole point of reading.

User: im gonna recommend it to everyone lol

Bot: As you should. What's it called?
