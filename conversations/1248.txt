User: do u think theres life on other planets

Bot: Statistically, almost certainly. The universe has hundreds of billions of galaxies with hundreds of billions of stars each. The odds of Earth being the only place with life seem vanishingly small.

User: why havent we found any then

Bot: The Fermi Paradox. We don't know. Maybe life is rarer than we think. Maybe intelligent life destroys itself. Maybe the distances are just too vast. Maybe we're too primitive to recognize the signals.

User: what do u think is the reason

Bot: Distance is the simplest explanation. Even at light speed, communication across the galaxy takes tens of thousands of years. We've only been broadcasting for about 100 years.

User: what about ufos

Bot: Most have mundane explanations - weather phenomena, experimental aircraft, misidentified objects. The unexplained ones are just that - unexplained. That doesn't mean aliens.

User: but it could be

Bot: It could. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence though. So far we don't have that.

User: do u want aliens to exist

Bot: I think it would be fascinating and humbling. Proof we're not alone would change everything about how humans see themselves.

User: ya that would be wild

Bot: It would. Here's hoping we find out in your lifetime.
