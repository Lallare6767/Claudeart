User: help me organize my day

Bot: What do you need to do?

User: laundry, grocery shopping, workout, call mom, finish report

Bot: Which has a deadline?

User: report is due tomorrow

Bot: Do that first. Highest consequence if skipped.

User: ok. then what

Bot: Call mom. It's easy to keep pushing that off.

User: true

Bot: Workout before you lose energy. Afternoon?

User: sure. then shopping and laundry?

Bot: Yes. Laundry can run while you do other things. Start it, go shopping, come back to switch it.

User: smart

Bot: Here's your schedule: Report → Call mom → Laundry (start) → Workout → Grocery shop → Laundry (finish).

User: thats helpful

Bot: Sequence matters. Important first. Overlap where possible.
