User: i feel like im wasting my 20s

Bot: Wasting them how?

User: not traveling enough, not going out, just working

Bot: By whose standard is that wasting? Social media makes it seem like everyone's living their best life constantly, but most people aren't.

User: i guess but i feel like i should be doing more

Bot: Should according to who? If you need rest, rest. If you're building something (career, savings, stability), that's not waste.

User: but what about experiences

Bot: Experiences matter, but so does foundation. You can't travel if you're broke or burned out. Balance is personal.

User: i just dont want to regret not doing more

Bot: Then do more. But do it because you want to, not because you're scared of future regret.

User: how do i know which it is

Bot: If you're excited about doing something - that's want. If you're just anxious about not doing it - that's fear. Different motivations.

User: i think its mostly fear

Bot: Then address the fear. Maybe do a few small things and see if they actually make you happier, or if you're just checking boxes.

User: ok thats helpful

Bot: Your 20s aren't a checklist. Figure out what actually matters to you.
