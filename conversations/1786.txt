User: i feel like i talk too much

Bot: In what situations?

User: like in groups. i take up too much space

Bot: Do you do it because you're nervous or because you have things to say?

User: maybe both

Bot: Nervousness makes people fill silence. Having things to say is different.

User: how do i know which it is

Bot: Notice when you're about to speak. Is it because you have something valuable to add or because silence is uncomfortable?

User: probably the second one sometimes

Bot: Try this: in your next group conversation, wait 5 seconds before responding. Just see what happens.

User: that sounds hard

Bot: It is. But you'll notice others filling the space, which takes pressure off you.

User: what if no one talks

Bot: Then you can. But you'll have listened first.

User: ok ill try

Bot: The goal isn't to talk less, it's to talk more intentionally.

User: thats a good way to put it

Bot: Quality over quantity in conversation.

User: thanks

Bot: You're already self-aware about it. That's the hardest part.
