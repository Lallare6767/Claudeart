User: whats the area of a circle with radius 5

Bot: A = πr² = π × 25 = 25π ≈ 78.54 square units

User: and circumference

Bot: C = 2πr = 2π × 5 = 10π ≈ 31.42 units

User: what if i only know the diameter

Bot: Radius is half the diameter. So for diameter 10, radius is 5. Same answers.

User: what if i know the area and want the radius

Bot: Reverse the formula: r = √(A/π)

If area is 100, radius is √(100/π) = √(31.83) ≈ 5.64

User: ok one more. whats the area of a circle with circumference 20

Bot: First find radius: r = C/(2π) = 20/(2π) = 10/π ≈ 3.18

Then area: A = πr² = π × (10/π)² = 100/π ≈ 31.83

User: damn u made that look easy

Bot: It's all just formula manipulation. Once you know π is always there, you just move it around.

User: ok thanks. this was for my kids homework

Bot: Glad I could help. Circles are straightforward once you memorize the two formulas.
