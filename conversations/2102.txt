User: i cant remember my childhood

Bot: At all?

User: bits and pieces. but most is blank

Bot: How does that feel?

User: weird. like part of me is missing

Bot: Childhood amnesia is common for early years. How far back can you remember?

User: maybe 10 or 11

Bot: That's later than typical. Was your childhood difficult?

User: i dont know. thats the problem

Bot: Memory gaps can be protective.

User: what do u mean

Bot: Brain sometimes suppresses painful memories.

User: so something bad happened?

Bot: Not necessarily. But it's worth exploring with a professional.

User: that scares me

Bot: Understandably. But not knowing might be scarier long term.

User: what if i dont want to remember

Bot: That's your choice. You're not obligated to excavate.

User: but it affects me

Bot: How?

User: i dont know who i am. where i came from

Bot: Then it might be worth exploring. Carefully, with support.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: A good therapist can help you do this safely.
