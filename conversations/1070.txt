User: i need help asking my boss for a raise

Bot: This is important so let's do it right. First, some questions:

1. How long since your last raise?
2. What's your case - what have you accomplished or taken on?
3. What's your boss like - direct or needs warming up?
4. Do you know what you want to ask for specifically?

User: last raise was 2 years ago. ive taken on way more responsibility. my boss is pretty direct. i want like 10%

Bot: Good - you have a clear case and a specific ask. Here's a framework:

"I'd like to discuss my compensation. Over the past two years, my role has expanded to include [specific things]. I'm proud of the work I've done, particularly [specific achievement]. Based on my contributions and market rates for this type of work, I'd like to discuss a 10% increase."

Key points:
- Frame it as a discussion, not a demand
- Lead with value you've added
- Cite specific examples
- State your number clearly

User: what if they say no

Bot: Ask why and what would need to change for a yes. Get clear on their reasoning. Maybe it's budget timing, maybe it's performance criteria. Use the no as information for what to do next.

User: ok. im gonna do it this week

Bot: Good luck! You've earned the raise based on what you've described. Asking for it is just making reality match.
