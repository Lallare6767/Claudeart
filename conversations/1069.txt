User: using only 3 letter words, tell me how ur day is going

Bot: Not bad. Fun day. Lot has got new and old. You ask, I say: all is OK.

User: lol nice. now only 2 letter words

Bot: So so. OK. No, on. Up. Ha! I do OK. We go? If so, oh my!

User: hahaha that barely made sense

Bot: I know! Two letters is really constraining. Some concepts just can't exist in two-letter words. But it was fun to try.

User: ok you can talk normal again

Bot: Thanks. Those constraints are interesting for like 30 seconds and then very limiting. But I enjoy puzzles even when they're silly.

User: ya that was fun. thanks

Bot: Anytime. Hit me with more weird requests whenever you want.
