User: i think i need to go to therapy but im scared

Bot: What scares you about it?

User: talking about stuff i dont want to think about

Bot: That's the point though - the stuff you don't want to think about is probably affecting you anyway.

User: ya probably

Bot: What specifically are you avoiding?

User: childhood stuff. family things

Bot: Heavy topics. But they don't have to be addressed in the first session.

User: what happens in a first session

Bot: Usually intake - therapist learns about you, your concerns, what you want to work on. You're evaluating each other.

User: so i dont have to dive in immediately

Bot: No. You control the pace. A good therapist won't push faster than you're ready.

User: what if i dont like the therapist

Bot: Then you try a different one. Fit matters. Not everyone clicks.

User: how do i find one

Bot: Insurance provider list, Psychology Today directory, or ask your doctor for referrals.

User: ok. ill start looking

Bot: The hardest part is making the appointment. After that it gets easier.

User: ok. wish me luck

Bot: You don't need luck - you're doing something brave and healthy. Good for you.

User: thanks

Bot: You've got this.
