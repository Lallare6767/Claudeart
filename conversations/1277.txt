User: help i agreed to something i dont want to do

Bot: What is it?

User: help my friend move this weekend

Bot: How firm was the yes?

User: pretty firm. but im dreading it

Bot: You have a few options. One: do it anyway and accept it's just a few hours. Two: be honest - "I know I said yes but I'm really overwhelmed and can't do it." Three: offer an alternative - "I can't be there all day but I can help for an hour."

User: option two feels bad

Bot: It's not great to back out. But it's worse to do it and resent them. Which would harm the friendship more?

User: probably the resentment

Bot: Then be honest. Say you overcommitted and can't do it. Most friends understand.

User: what if they get mad

Bot: They might be disappointed. But if your friendship can't survive one reschedule, it's not that strong anyway.

User: ya true. but i should prob just do it

Bot: If you can do it without resentment, do it. If not, back out gracefully. Don't half-ass either choice.

User: ok ill go. itll be fine

Bot: Good. Bring snacks and it'll go faster.
