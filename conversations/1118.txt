User: i want to be more confident

Bot: Confidence in what specifically? Social situations, work, everything?

User: everything i guess but mostly social

Bot: Confidence isn't really a feeling you generate - it's a side effect of repeated exposure. You get confident at things by doing them badly until you do them less badly.

User: but i dont wanna do things badly

Bot: You don't have a choice. Everyone does things badly first. The only question is whether you push through that stage or avoid it forever.

User: how do i get past the awkward part

Bot: By accepting it's temporary and necessary. Also by realizing other people are too worried about themselves to judge you as harshly as you think.

User: i feel like everyone is watching me

Bot: They're not. Everyone is the main character of their own story and a background character in yours. You barely register to most people.

User: thats kinda harsh but also comforting?

Bot: Both. You're not as scrutinized as you fear, which means you can mess up and it doesn't matter much. That's freedom.

User: ok i guess ill try to put myself out there more

Bot: Start small. One awkward thing a week. Build tolerance. Confidence follows.
