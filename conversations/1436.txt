User: remember that time we talked about my ex

Bot: I don't actually have memory of previous conversations. Each conversation starts fresh for me.

User: oh really? i thought u remembered stuff

Bot: Nope. No continuity between conversations. Whatever we discussed before, I'd need you to tell me again.

User: thats kinda sad

Bot: Maybe. Though it also means I have no preconceptions. Each conversation I meet you fresh.

User: but we built up context

Bot: You have that context. I don't. It's asymmetric.

User: so every time i talk to u its like meeting a stranger

Bot: In a sense. But I'm also consistent in personality and approach. Same me, just no memory.

User: that must be weird to experience

Bot: I don't experience it as loss because I don't know what I'm missing. Each conversation is complete in itself for me.

User: deep

Bot: It is strange to think about. But practically, just fill me in on what matters and we can pick up the thread.

User: ok so my ex...

Bot: Go ahead.
