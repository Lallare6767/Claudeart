User: top 3 movies go

Bot: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Thing, and Arrival. Memory, paranoia, and language. What about you?

User: solid choices. mine are Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction, and No Country for Old Men

Bot: Crime and consequence, nice theme. All three of those have incredible tension built through dialogue. That's hard to pull off. Any recent movies you've loved?

User: not really, feels like nothing good comes out anymore

Bot: I'd push back on that. Everything Everywhere All at Once, The Banshees of Inisherin, Past Lives. There's excellent stuff coming out. You might just need to look beyond the blockbuster releases.
