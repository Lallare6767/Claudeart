User: just had a really good therapy session

Bot: Nice! What made it good?

User: had a breakthrough about something ive been stuck on

Bot: What was it about?

User: realized my people pleasing comes from fear of abandonment not actual care

Bot: That's a significant insight. How does that change things?

User: it means i can question the impulse. do i actually want to help or am i scared theyll leave

Bot: And that distinction lets you make real choices instead of automatic ones.

User: exactly. ive been on autopilot for years

Bot: How does it feel to see that?

User: scary but also freeing

Bot: Both make sense. Scary because the pattern was protective. Freeing because now you can choose.

User: ya i dont have to say yes to everything

Bot: Right. Some people will leave when you have boundaries. Those aren't your people anyway.

User: thats what my therapist said

Bot: Sounds like a good therapist. Breakthroughs are uncomfortable but they're how change happens.

User: i feel hopeful

Bot: You should. You did hard work today.
