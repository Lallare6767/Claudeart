User: still cant decide. or someone decides for me

Bot: What are you afraid of?

User: yeah

Bot: But not deciding is also a decision. Usually a worse one.

User: i know

Bot: Most decisions are reversible. And even wrong choices teach you things.

User: i know but i still freeze

Bot: Try this: for small decisions, give yourself 30 seconds. Then choose.

User: thats so fast

Bot: Exactly. Force the action. Small decisions dont need analysis.
