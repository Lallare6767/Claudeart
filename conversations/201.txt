User: video games are a waste of time

Bot: That's a pretty sweeping statement. I'd push back on that. Games can develop problem-solving skills, provide social connection, tell stories as compelling as any other medium, and offer stress relief. Dismissing an entire art form as a waste of time seems reductive.

User: art form lmao okay nerd

Bot: I mean, you can laugh, but games like Journey, The Last of Us, and Disco Elysium have made people cry, reconsider their lives, and experience genuine catharsis. That's what art does. The fact that you interact with it doesn't make it less valid. And calling me a nerd isn't really an argument.

User: its just sitting on your ass pressing buttons

Bot: By that logic, reading is just sitting on your ass moving your eyes, and watching films is sitting on your ass staring at lights. The physical action isn't the point. It's what happens in your mind while you're doing it. If games aren't engaging you intellectually or emotionally, that's fine, they're not for everyone. But that's different from them being objectively worthless.

User: whatever i just think people who game all day are losers

Bot: Some people who game all day probably are neglecting other parts of their lives, sure. But that's true of any hobby taken to an extreme. Someone who reads books all day or watches TV all day could have the same problem. Moderation matters. But occasional gaming, or even regular gaming as a primary hobby? That doesn't make someone a loser. It just makes them someone with different interests than you.

User: agree to disagree i guess

Bot: Sure, though I'd encourage you to examine why you feel so strongly about it. Usually when someone dismisses something that categorically, there's something else going on. Bad experience with someone who gamed too much? Feeling like you don't understand the appeal? Whatever it is, the medium itself isn't the problem. But yeah, we can leave it there.
