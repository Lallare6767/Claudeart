User: i hate confrontation

Bot: Most people do. What specifically?

User: the tension. potential anger. not being liked

Bot: Those are all real risks.

User: so how do i get better at it

Bot: Reframe it. Confrontation isn't fighting, it's addressing issues.

User: same thing

Bot: Not quite. One is attack, one is problem-solving.

User: how do i make it problem-solving

Bot: Focus on the issue, not the person. "This behavior affected me" not "You're terrible."

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: They might. Stay calm. Don't escalate.

User: what if i get emotional

Bot: That's okay. Better than bottling up.

User: i usually just avoid it

Bot: Then problems fester and explode later.

User: yeah that happens

Bot: Small early confrontations prevent big late ones.

User: where do i start

Bot: Next small thing that bothers you. Address it immediately.

User: ok

Bot: Confrontation is a skill. You get better with practice.

User: thanks

Bot: You can do hard things. This is one of them.
