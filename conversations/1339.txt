User: i have a crush on someone and its driving me crazy

Bot: What's making it crazy?

User: i cant stop thinking about them and i dont know if they like me

Bot: How do you know them?

User: we work together

Bot: That complicates things. Workplace crushes have higher stakes.

User: i know but i cant help it

Bot: Feelings are fine - it's actions that matter. Have you talked to them beyond work?

User: a little. we've had lunch a few times

Bot: Initiated by you or them?

User: both

Bot: That's a decent sign. They're choosing to spend time with you. Are they in a relationship?

User: no theyre single

Bot: Then you could test the waters. Coffee outside of work isn't weird between coworkers. See how they respond.

User: what if it makes work awkward

Bot: If you're casual about it and they decline gracefully, it doesn't have to be awkward. The key is not making it a big declaration.

User: so just ask for coffee?

Bot: Yes. Low stakes. "Want to grab coffee sometime outside of work?" Simple and gives them an easy out if they're not interested.

User: ok maybe ill try that

Bot: Good luck. The uncertainty is usually worse than knowing.
