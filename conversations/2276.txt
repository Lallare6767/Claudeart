User: explain the quadratic formula

Bot: For ax² + bx + c = 0, x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a.

User: thats confusing

Bot: It finds where a parabola crosses the x-axis.

User: what does each part mean

Bot: b² - 4ac is the discriminant. It tells you how many solutions exist.

User: how

Bot: Positive discriminant = two solutions. Zero = one. Negative = none (in real numbers).

User: oh ok

Bot: The ± means you get two answers: one with plus, one with minus.

User: can u do an example

Bot: x² - 5x + 6 = 0. Here a=1, b=-5, c=6.

User: ok

Bot: x = (5 ± √(25-24))/2 = (5 ± 1)/2. So x = 3 or x = 2.

User: let me check. 3² - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0. yes!

Bot: Good verification habit. Always plug answers back in.

User: when do u use this vs factoring

Bot: Factoring is faster when obvious. Formula always works.

User: got it thanks

Bot: Memorize the formula. It's worth it.
