User: whats the circumference of a circle

Bot: 2 times pi times radius. Or pi times diameter.

User: pi is 3.14 right

Bot: Roughly. More precisely 3.14159...

User: so if radius is 5

Bot: Circumference = 2 × 3.14 × 5 = 31.4.

User: what about diameter 10

Bot: Same answer. Pi × 10 = 31.4.

User: because diameter is twice radius

Bot: Exactly.

User: what about area

Bot: Pi times radius squared.

User: so radius 5

Bot: 3.14 × 25 = 78.5.

User: why squared

Bot: Area fills 2D space. Squaring captures that.

User: makes sense

Bot: Just remember: circumference is outside, area is inside.

User: C = 2πr, A = πr²

Bot: Perfect. Those are worth memorizing.
