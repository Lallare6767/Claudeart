User: what is the pythagorean theorem

Bot: a² + b² = c². For right triangles, legs squared sum to hypotenuse squared.

User: how do i use it

Bot: If you know two sides, you can find the third.

User: example

Bot: Triangle with legs 3 and 4. 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5². Hypotenuse is 5.

User: now i try?

Bot: Legs are 5 and 12. Find hypotenuse.

User: 25 + 144 = 169. square root of 169 is 13

Bot: Perfect.

User: what if i know hypotenuse and one leg

Bot: Rearrange: b² = c² - a².

User: so hypotenuse 10, leg 6. find other leg

Bot: You try.

User: b² = 100 - 36 = 64. b = 8

Bot: Correct. 6-8-10 is a common triple.

User: common triple?

Bot: Whole number solutions. 3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-15-17. Worth memorizing.

User: helpful

Bot: Pythagorean theorem is one of the most useful in math. Know it cold.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice. It shows up everywhere.
