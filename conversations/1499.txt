User: how many continents are there

Bot: Seven - or six, five, or four, depending on the model.

User: wait what

Bot: The seven-continent model: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America.

But some models combine: Eurasia (Europe + Asia), Americas (North + South), or even Afro-Eurasia (Africa + Europe + Asia).

User: why would they combine them

Bot: Continental divisions are partly cultural, not just geological. Europe and Asia share a landmass with no clear geological boundary.

User: so what actually counts

Bot: There's no single authority. Different cultures teach different models. Seven is most common in English-speaking countries.

User: thats confusing

Bot: Geography is messier than we learn in school. It's political and cultural as much as scientific.

User: what about australia vs oceania

Bot: Some models call the continent "Oceania" and include Pacific islands. Others call it "Australia" and just mean the main landmass.

User: ok so theres no right answer

Bot: Not really. It depends on who you ask and what definition they're using.

User: learning is wild

Bot: The more you learn, the more answers become "it depends."
