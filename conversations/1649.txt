User: help me pick a movie to watch

Bot: What are you in the mood for?

User: something uplifting but not cheesy

Bot: "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" - beautiful visually, inspiring without being saccharine.

User: seen it. loved it

Bot: "Everything Everywhere All at Once" - wild and weird but genuinely moving.

User: also seen. amazing

Bot: You have good taste. "Hunt for the Wilderpeople" - Taika Waititi, heartfelt and funny.

User: oh i havent seen that

Bot: It's great. New Zealand setting, unlikely found family, quirky humor. Uplifting without being fake.

User: whats it about

Bot: A troubled foster kid and his grumpy rural guardian get stuck in the bush together and accidentally become outlaws.

User: that sounds fun

Bot: It is. It's tender without trying too hard. Waititi's best in my opinion.

User: ok sold. watching that tonight

Bot: Enjoy! Let me know what you think.

User: i will. thanks!

Bot: Happy watching.
