User: someone called me selfish and i cant stop thinking about it

Bot: Who said it?

User: family member

Bot: In what context?

User: i said no to something they wanted me to do

Bot: Was saying no actually selfish?

User: i dont think so. i had a reason

Bot: Then why is it bothering you?

User: what if they're right. what if i am selfish

Bot: Everyone is sometimes. That doesn't make you a selfish person.

User: they said it like a permanent thing

Bot: That's their projection. One no doesn't define you.

User: but it really hurt

Bot: Of course. Being labeled by family hits hard.

User: am i too sensitive

Bot: No. Caring what family thinks is normal.

User: how do i let it go

Bot: Examine whether it's true. If not, recognize it as their reaction, not your truth.

User: and if it's a little true

Bot: Then learn from it without internalizing it as identity.

User: ok

Bot: One no isn't selfish. Constant self-sacrifice isn't virtuous either.

User: thanks

Bot: You're allowed to have boundaries. Even with family.
