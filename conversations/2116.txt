User: give me riddle about time

Bot: I have no legs but I always run. I have no mouth but you hear me. I have no body but I die. What am I?

User: hmm

Bot: Think about what runs without moving.

User: a river?

Bot: Close! But rivers don't die.

User: a clock?

Bot: Getting warmer but clocks don't run without legs in that sense.

User: time?

Bot: Time runs but doesn't move, you hear time "tick," but time doesn't die exactly...

User: im stuck

Bot: It's a clock. The clock runs, you hear it tick, the battery dies.

User: oh i was close

Bot: Another one: what has hands but can't clap?

User: a clock again

Bot: Correct! What can you catch but not throw?

User: um a cold?

Bot: Got it! You're good at these.

User: these are fun

Bot: Riddles make you think differently.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep that brain sharp.
