User: i feel like giving up on dating

Bot: What happened?

User: endless bad dates. no connection. exhausting

Bot: How long have you been at it?

User: year and a half

Bot: On apps?

User: mostly

Bot: Apps are designed to keep you swiping. Not to find you a partner.

User: what do you mean

Bot: Their revenue depends on you staying. Finding someone ends that.

User: so theyre working against me

Bot: Not exactly. But their incentives don't align with yours.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Take a break. Date differently.

User: how

Bot: Activities. Classes. Through friends. Places where people share interests.

User: harder to meet people that way

Bot: Fewer people but better fit.

User: ok

Bot: And reset expectations. Dating is hard. One and a half years isn't that long.

User: feels long

Bot: It does. But relationships last decades. Worth taking time to find right one.

User: ok

Bot: Take a break. Come back refreshed. Try new approaches.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You'll find someone. Just not through burnout.
