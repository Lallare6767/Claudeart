User: if 3x - 7 = 2x + 5 what is x

Bot: x = 12.

User: show me

Bot: Subtract 2x from both sides: x - 7 = 5. Add 7: x = 12.

User: what about 5x + 3 = 3x + 11

Bot: x = 4.

User: let me try. subtract 3x: 2x + 3 = 11. subtract 3: 2x = 8. divide by 2: x = 4

Bot: Perfect!

User: what about 4(x - 2) = 2x + 6

Bot: x = 7.

User: ok distribute first: 4x - 8 = 2x + 6. subtract 2x: 2x - 8 = 6. add 8: 2x = 14. x = 7

Bot: Excellent. You've got this.

User: these feel good to solve

Bot: There's something satisfying about equations working out.

User: yeah like a puzzle

Bot: Algebra is puzzles with rules. Same satisfaction when it clicks.

User: thanks for the practice

Bot: Keep solving. The skill stays with practice.

User: will do

Bot: Good luck!
