User: ok random but do fish get thirsty

Bot: In a way. Freshwater fish are constantly absorbing water through osmosis, so they don't drink - they actually excrete a lot to stay balanced. Saltwater fish lose water to their environment, so they drink constantly.

User: wait so saltwater fish drink saltwater

Bot: Yes, they have to. Then their bodies filter out the excess salt through specialized cells in their gills.

User: thats wild. what about whales

Bot: Same thing. Whales are mammals in saltwater, so they drink seawater and excrete concentrated urine to remove the salt. They also get water from the fish they eat.

User: do fish sleep

Bot: Sort of. They don't have eyelids or the same sleep cycles, but they have rest periods where their activity decreases. Some float in place, some tuck into crevices.

Bot: Anytime. Fish are weirder than people think.
