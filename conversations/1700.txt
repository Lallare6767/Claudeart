User: i just finished a book and i feel empty

Bot: That post-book sadness is real. What did you read?

User: a long fantasy series. took me months

Bot: Months of living in that world, and now it's over. The emptiness makes sense.

User: i dont want to start anything new

Bot: Because nothing will be that?

User: exactly

Bot: Give yourself a few days. Read something completely different as a palate cleanser.

User: like what

Bot: Non-fiction, short stories, poetry - something that isn't trying to replace what you just finished.

User: good idea

Bot: Then when you're ready, you'll find another world to fall into.

User: do u think ill love anything that much again

Bot: Yes. You've probably felt this before after other books. The capacity doesn't go away.

User: thats true

Bot: The emptiness is just proof of how much you cared. That's a good thing.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: The best stories leave you changed. The grief is part of that.

User: thanks

Bot: Enjoy the lingering. Not everyone gets to feel books that deeply.
