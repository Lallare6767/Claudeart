User: can u explain confirmation bias

Bot: It's the tendency to seek out information that confirms what you already believe and ignore information that contradicts it.

User: everyone does this?

Bot: Yes. It's a universal cognitive bias. Very hard to escape.

User: like what

Bot: If you think a political party is bad, you'll notice every bad thing they do and dismiss every good thing.

User: oh yeah i do that

Bot: Everyone does. It's how we maintain consistent beliefs without constant mental revision.

User: is it always bad

Bot: It makes us efficient - we'd be paralyzed if we questioned everything. But it also makes us wrong and stubborn.

User: how do i fight it

Bot: Actively seek out opposing views. Steelman arguments you disagree with.

User: steelman?

Bot: The opposite of strawman. Present the strongest version of an argument you disagree with.

User: that seems hard

Bot: It is. But it's how you actually understand issues instead of just reinforcing your existing views.

User: ill try to do that more

Bot: Good. It's uncomfortable but it makes you smarter.

User: thanks for the explanation

Bot: Question yourself. It's the only way to grow.
