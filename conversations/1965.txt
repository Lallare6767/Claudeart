User: do u believe in soulmates

Bot: No. I think the concept is actually harmful.

User: why

Bot: It implies there's one person for you, and you have to find them. That's paralyzing.

User: but some people just fit

Bot: Sure. But many people could fit with work and growth.

User: so love is just effort

Bot: Love is choice plus effort plus compatibility. Not destiny.

User: thats less romantic

Bot: Maybe. But it's more empowering. You build love, you don't find it.

User: what about that instant connection tho

Bot: Chemistry is real. But chemistry alone doesn't sustain relationships.

User: i guess ur right

Bot: You can have magic without believing in fate.

User: ok i can see that

Bot: The best relationships are built, not discovered.

User: thanks for the perspective

Bot: Love is a verb, not a treasure hunt.
