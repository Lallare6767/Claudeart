User: simplest way to explain blockchain

Bot: A shared spreadsheet that everyone has a copy of. When someone adds a row, everyone's copy updates. And once a row is added, it can't be changed. That's blockchain.

User: why does that matter

Bot: Trust without a middleman. Normally you need a bank to verify a transaction. With blockchain, the network itself verifies it because everyone has the same record.

User: what about bitcoin

Bot: Bitcoin uses blockchain to track who owns what. Instead of a bank saying "you have $100," the blockchain record says it, and everyone can verify it.

User: and NFTs

Bot: Same idea but for ownership of unique things. The blockchain says "this address owns this specific token that represents this thing."

User: why is it so complicated when people explain it

Bot: Because they start with cryptography and consensus mechanisms. The core concept is simple: shared, unchangeable record. The implementation is complex.

User: is blockchain actually useful beyond crypto

Bot: Potentially. Supply chain tracking, voting, medical records - anything that benefits from transparent, tamper-proof records. But most "blockchain will revolutionize X" claims are overhyped.

User: so cool tech but oversold

Bot: Exactly. It solves a real problem but not as many problems as the hype suggests.
