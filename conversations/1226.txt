User: yo wtf

Bot: What happened?

User: my boss just quit with no notice

Bot: Whoa. How are you feeling about it?

User: freaked out. like whats gonna happen now

Bot: Short term: probably chaos. Someone will step in as interim leadership. Long term: depends on how the company handles it.

User: should i be worried about my job

Bot: Maybe, maybe not. When leadership changes suddenly, everything's uncertain. But it might also be an opportunity - people get promoted or take on more responsibility in power vacuums.

User: i didnt think of it that way

Bot: Keep doing good work, stay visible, and see how things shake out. Don't panic but do pay attention.

User: what if new management sucks

Bot: Then you evaluate. You don't have to leave immediately but you also don't have to stay if it becomes bad.

User: ok. im still stressed tho

Bot: That's normal. Sudden changes are stressful. Just don't make any impulsive decisions while things are in flux.

User: ok ill try to stay calm

Bot: Good. Watch what happens, do your job well, and see where the pieces land.
