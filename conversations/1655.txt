User: i got promoted!!!!

Bot: Congratulations! That's huge. What's the new role?

User: team lead! i manage 4 ppl now

Bot: That's a significant step. How are you feeling about it?

User: excited but also terrified

Bot: Both make sense. Leading people is different from doing the work yourself.

User: any advice

Bot: Listen more than you talk. Your job is to make your team successful, not to be the smartest in the room.

User: what if they dont respect me

Bot: Earn it by being fair, consistent, and having their backs. Respect follows competence and character.

User: i want to be a good boss

Bot: The fact that you care about that already puts you ahead of most.

User: thanks! im so hyped

Bot: Celebrate this. You earned it. Then get ready to learn a ton.

User: will do!

Bot: Good luck! You're going to do great.
