User: how did u know to divide by 12

Bot: 12 is the greatest common factor of 24 and 36. You can find it by factoring or just recognize it from knowing your multiplication tables.

Both divisible by 15.

User: and 18/81

Bot: 18/81 = 2/9

Both divisible by 9.

User: im trying to help my kid with homework lol

Bot: These are classic GCF problems. The trick is recognizing common factors quickly. Start with small primes: can both be divided by 2? By 3? By 5? Keep going until they can't be reduced.

User: thats a good tip

Bot: Yeah. And for stuff like 18/81, noticing that both end in digits that scream "divisible by 9" helps. 1+8=9, 8+1=9.

User: oh thats clever

Bot: Divisibility rules are shortcuts. Worth teaching those alongside the fractions.

User: ok thanks. homework time

Bot: Good luck to both of you.
