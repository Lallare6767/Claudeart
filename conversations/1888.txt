User: i feel like i dont belong anywhere

Bot: What contexts are you thinking of?

User: everywhere. work. friend groups. even family

Bot: That's a pervasive feeling. When did it start?

User: honestly always

Bot: Has anyone ever felt like your people?

User: maybe a few. briefly

Bot: What was different about those times?

User: i felt understood. like i could be myself

Bot: So belonging requires being seen and accepted.

User: i guess

Bot: Are you showing your real self in these places where you don't belong?

User: probably not

Bot: Then how could you belong? You're presenting a version they can't actually know.

User: but if i show the real me they might reject me

Bot: Some might. Some won't. You can't belong anywhere while hiding.

User: thats terrifying

Bot: It is. But the alternative is guaranteed isolation.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: You can't be accepted for who you are if you don't show who you are.

User: ok. thanks for the perspective

Bot: Find brave spaces to be yourself. That's where you'll belong.
