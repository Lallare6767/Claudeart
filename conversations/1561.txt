User: i think i need to cut off a toxic friend

Bot: What makes them toxic?

User: everything is about them. they only call when they need something. criticizes me but cant take any feedback

Bot: How long have you been friends?

User: 8 years

Bot: That's a long time. Has it always been like this or did it change?

User: i think its always been there but ive just noticed more recently

Bot: Sometimes we outgrow people. Or we develop better standards.

User: so should i cut them off

Bot: You could. Or you could try addressing it directly first.

User: ive tried. they get defensive and turn it around on me

Bot: Then you've done your part. You can't change someone who doesn't want to change.

User: but 8 years

Bot: Sunk cost. Those years don't make the friendship worth saving if it's hurting you now.

User: how do i even do it

Bot: You can fade - stop initiating, be less available. Or you can be direct - "This friendship isn't working for me anymore."

User: direct feels mean

Bot: It's actually kinder. Clear endings let people know where they stand.

User: ok. ill think about it

Bot: You deserve friendships that give as much as they take.
