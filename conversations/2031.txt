User: i keep self sabotaging

Bot: In what way?

User: when things go well i do something to mess it up

Bot: Like what?

User: start fights. miss deadlines. push people away

Bot: Any idea why?

User: my therapist says i dont think i deserve good things

Bot: That sounds right. Does it resonate?

User: yeah i guess

Bot: You're aware of it. That's the first step.

User: but i still do it

Bot: Awareness comes before change. They're not the same step.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Catch yourself in the moment. Pause before the sabotage.

User: i dont realize til after

Bot: Track it. Write down each instance. Patterns will emerge.

User: ok

Bot: What triggers it? Success? Happiness? Intimacy?

User: all of those

Bot: Work with your therapist on this specifically. It's deep work.

User: ok i will

Bot: You do deserve good things. Even if you don't believe it yet.
