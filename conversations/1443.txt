User: ugh my flight got delayed 4 hours

Bot: That's rough. Where are you headed?

User: home from a work trip. was supposed to land at 6 now its 10

Bot: Does anyone need to pick you up?

User: ya my partner. they rearranged their whole evening

Bot: Frustrating for both of you. Any lounge access or food vouchers?

User: they gave us a $15 food credit lol

Bot: The airline minimum effort. At least you can get something to eat.

User: i guess. just wanted to be home

Bot: Understandable. Work trips are exhausting and the travel home is supposed to be the relief.

User: exactly

Bot: Find a spot to sit, get comfortable, maybe watch something on your phone. Make the wait as bearable as possible.

User: ya i downloaded some shows before i left

Bot: Smart. Airports are tolerable with entertainment and bad without.

User: true. ok i should eat something

Bot: Good plan. Four hours is long - might as well take care of yourself.

User: thanks for listening to me complain

Bot: Travel complaints are always valid. Hope the rest of the trip is smooth.
