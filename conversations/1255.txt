User: im worried about my parents getting older

Bot: What specifically worries you?

User: just like their health declining and them dying

Bot: That's one of the heavy ones. Are they having health issues now or is this general anxiety?

User: general but they r in their 60s

Bot: 60s is still relatively young. Most people have 20+ years left at that age. Are you close with them?

User: ya pretty close

Bot: Then make sure they know that. Spend time with them while you can. Call more than you think you need to.

User: i feel like i should move closer

Bot: That's a personal calculation. Would moving make you happier or just ease the anxiety? Those aren't the same thing.

User: i dont know

Bot: Think about what you'd regret. If something happened and you hadn't moved, would you wish you had? That's your answer.

User: probably ya

Bot: Then maybe start looking into it. You don't have to decide immediately, but you can explore.

User: ya maybe. this stuff is hard

Bot: It is. Facing mortality - yours and theirs - is one of the hardest parts of being human.

User: ya. thanks for letting me talk about it

Bot: Anytime. These conversations matter.
