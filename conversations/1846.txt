User: i feel so behind everyone my age

Bot: Behind in what?

User: career. savings. relationship

Bot: Who are you comparing yourself to?

User: college friends mostly

Bot: Are you seeing their full picture or just their highlights?

User: highlights i guess

Bot: There you go.

User: but some of them are objectively ahead

Bot: Ahead by what metric? Income? Marriage? Their values might not be yours.

User: i guess i use their metrics

Bot: Why? Their goals aren't your goals.

User: i dont know what my goals are

Bot: That might be the actual problem, not being "behind."

User: maybe

Bot: If you don't know what you're aiming at, you'll feel behind everyone who does.

User: so i need to figure out what i want

Bot: Yes. Then you can compare yourself to your own progress instead of theirs.

User: thats hard

Bot: Harder than feeling inadequate all the time?

User: no. you're right

Bot: Define your own race. Then run it.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You're not behind. You're just running the wrong course.
