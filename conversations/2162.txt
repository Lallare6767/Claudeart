User: whats the difference between mean median mode

Bot: Mean is average. Median is middle value. Mode is most frequent.

User: show me with numbers

Bot: For 2, 3, 3, 4, 8: Mean = 20/5 = 4. Median = 3 (middle). Mode = 3 (appears twice).

User: what if theres no middle

Bot: Average the two middle numbers.

User: like 1, 2, 4, 5

Bot: Median = (2+4)/2 = 3.

User: when do u use each

Bot: Mean for typical data. Median when outliers skew things. Mode for categories.

User: outliers like what

Bot: Salaries: 50k, 50k, 50k, 50k, 1 million. Mean is 240k but that's misleading.

User: median would be 50k

Bot: Right. More representative.

User: what about no mode

Bot: If all numbers appear same frequency, no mode.

User: and multiple modes

Bot: Bimodal or multimodal. Like 1, 2, 2, 3, 3.

User: modes are 2 and 3

Bot: Exactly. All three measures tell you something different about data.

User: thanks!

Bot: Pick the right one for your question.
