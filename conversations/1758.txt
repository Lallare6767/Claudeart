User: what does pemdas mean again

Bot: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction. The order of operations.

User: so multiplication before addition

Bot: Yes. 2 + 3 × 4 = 2 + 12 = 14, not 5 × 4 = 20.

User: oh i thought it was 20

Bot: Common mistake. Multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

User: what about 8 ÷ 2 × 4

Bot: Left to right when they're the same level. 8 ÷ 2 = 4, then 4 × 4 = 16.

User: not 8 ÷ 8 = 1?

Bot: No - multiplication and division are same level, so left to right.

User: these rules are confusing

Bot: They're just conventions to avoid ambiguity. Everyone needs to solve expressions the same way.

User: what about parentheses

Bot: Always first. (2 + 3) × 4 = 5 × 4 = 20.

User: ok thats clearer

Bot: When in doubt, add parentheses to make your intention clear.

User: good tip

Bot: PEMDAS is just a rulebook. Learn it and math becomes consistent.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice a few problems and it'll stick.
