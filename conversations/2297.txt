User: i rember when life was simpler

Bot: When was that?

User: childhood i guess

Bot: Was it simpler, or were you just not aware of the complexity?

User: good question

Bot: Adults handled the hard stuff. You just didn't see it.

User: so it wasnt actually simpler

Bot: Not objectively. Just experientially for you.

User: i still miss it

Bot: You miss not knowing. That's understandable.

User: can i get that back

Bot: Not without ignorance. And you probably don't want that.

User: no

Bot: What you want is peace. That's possible without simplicity.

User: how

Bot: Acceptance. Some things are complex and that's okay.

User: easier said

Bot: Always. But awareness is the first step.

User: i guess i need to grow up more

Bot: Not grow up. Grow into. Complexity isn't bad. Resistance to it is.

User: ok

Bot: You can be at peace with a complex life. That's maturity.

User: thanks

Bot: The simple life wasn't better. It was just smaller. Your life now is bigger.
