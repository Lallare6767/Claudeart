User: i need to set boundaries with my parents but theyll be upset

Bot: They probably will be. That's not a reason to avoid it.

User: but theyre old

Bot: Old people can still respect boundaries.

User: what kind of boundaries

Bot: Calling before visiting? Not commenting on your weight? What do you need?

User: all of that. also less criticism

Bot: Those are reasonable.

User: how do i say it

Bot: Clearly and kindly. "I love you and I need [specific thing] to happen / stop."

User: they wont understand

Bot: They might not. Do it anyway.

User: then what

Bot: Enforce it. When they cross the boundary, remind them. Or leave.

User: leave?

Bot: If they visit unannounced after you asked them not to, you can go out.

User: that feels extreme

Bot: Boundaries without enforcement aren't boundaries.

User: ok

Bot: They'll adjust. People do when they have to.

User: what if they guilt me

Bot: They will. Guilt is their problem, not yours.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You can love them and have limits. Both are true.
