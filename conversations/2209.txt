User: someone told me i have potential

Bot: How did that feel?

User: like a backhanded compliment

Bot: Why?

User: potential means im not there yet

Bot: Or it means they see more in you than you've shown.

User: or that im wasting it

Bot: That's one interpretation.

User: the most obvious one

Bot: Depends on context. Who said it?

User: my boss

Bot: Could be encouragement or critique.

User: which do u think

Bot: What's your relationship like?

User: decent. they push me

Bot: Then probably encouragement. They want you to reach for more.

User: but why not just say im doing well

Bot: Because they think you could do better.

User: frustrating

Bot: Or motivating. Depends on how you use it.

User: i guess

Bot: "Potential" means ceiling, not floor. Take it as aspiration.

User: ok

Bot: Prove them right. Then they'll talk about your performance.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Turn the potential into product.
