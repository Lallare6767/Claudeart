User: help me figure out if i should buy this thing

Bot: What is it and how much?

User: a $300 espresso machine

Bot: Do you currently buy espresso?

User: yeah like 3-4 times a week. $5 each

Bot: That's $60-80/month. The machine pays for itself in 4-5 months.

User: oh wow i didnt do the math

Bot: Will you actually use it though? A lot of espresso machines end up as counter decorations.

User: i think so. i love espresso

Bot: Do you have space for it? Good espresso machines are big.

User: yeah i got room

Bot: And you're okay with the learning curve? Making good espresso takes practice.

User: im down to learn

User: thanks for helping me think through it

Bot: The math works out. Just make sure to actually use it.

User: i will. ordering it now
