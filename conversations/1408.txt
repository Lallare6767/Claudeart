User: whats 7^3

Bot: 343.

User: how bout 5^4

Bot: 625.

User: 2^10

Bot: 1024.

User: why is that one famous

Bot: It's a kilobyte in computing. Computers work in powers of 2, so 2^10 = 1024 comes up constantly.

User: oh like megabytes and stuff

Bot: Exactly. 2^20 = 1,048,576 is a megabyte. 2^30 = about a billion is a gigabyte.

User: wait so a gigabyte isnt exactly a billion

Bot: Right. It's 1,073,741,824. The "giga" is borrowed from metric (billion) but it's actually 2^30.

User: thats confusing

Bot: It is. There's actually been debate about creating new names (gibibyte, mebibyte) for the exact powers of 2, but they haven't caught on.

User: computers make everything complicated

Bot: They really do. But once you understand it's all powers of 2, a lot of it makes sense.

User: ok one more. 3^5

Bot: 243. 3, 9, 27, 81, 243.

User: nice thanks for the math practice

Bot: Anytime.
