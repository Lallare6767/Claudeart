User: i just got back from a funeral

Bot: I'm sorry for your loss. How are you holding up?

User: weird. more numb than sad

Bot: Numbness is a common response. Grief doesn't always show up as tears.

User: i feel like i should be more affected

Bot: Should according to who? There's no right way to grieve.

User: everyone else was crying

Bot: They have their process. You have yours.

User: maybe it hasnt hit me yet

Bot: That's possible. Sometimes grief is delayed while you're in logistics mode.

User: i was helping plan it

Bot: There you go. You were in task mode. The feelings might come later.

User: what do i do now

Bot: Rest. Let yourself feel whatever comes up. Don't force emotions.

User: and if nothing comes

Bot: Then that's your experience. You don't have to perform grief.

User: i feel guilty about not feeling more

Bot: The guilt is a feeling. Maybe that's your form of grief right now.

User: huh. i didnt think of that

Bot: Be patient with yourself. Grief comes in its own time.

User: ok thank you

Bot: Take care. I'm sorry for your loss.
