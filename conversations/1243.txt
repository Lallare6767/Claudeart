User: give me 5 would you rather questions

Bot: 1. Would you rather always speak your mind or never speak again?
2. Would you rather know when you're going to die or how?
3. Would you rather be famous for something you didn't do or unknown for something great you did?
4. Would you rather live in the past or the future?
5. Would you rather have every song you hear slowly turn to your least favorite song, or every movie slowly turn to your least favorite movie?

User: ooh these r good. whats ur answer to the first one

Bot: Always speak my mind. I already kind of do that. Silence would be worse than occasional discomfort.

User: what about the famous one

Bot: Unknown for something great. The fame would feel hollow. The actual achievement is what matters to me.

User: damn thats a good answer

Bot: Thanks. These questions are designed to reveal values. The "right" answer depends on what you prioritize.

User: ya i picked the opposite for that one

Bot: Interesting. What's the reasoning?

User: i feel like impact matters even if u dont get credit

Bot: That's valid. We're actually agreeing - you want impact, I want achievement. Both prioritize the work over the recognition.

User: oh true. cool questions thanks

Bot: Anytime. They're fun for parties too.
