User: make up a word and define it

Bot: "Chronosomnia" - the state of being unable to sleep because you're acutely aware of time passing.

User: oh thats a real feeling. another one

Bot: "Friendstalgia" - nostalgia for friendships that were never as close as you remember them being.

User: damn. too real. more

Bot: "Screenburn" - the mental exhaustion from switching between too many browser tabs and apps.

User: lol i have that right now. one more

Bot: "Umwishing" - wanting to take back something you just said in the moment you're saying it.

User: THAT. i do that all the time

Bot: These are all universal experiences without words. That's why making them up is satisfying.

User: should i use these in daily conversation

Bot: If you explain them, sure. "I'm experiencing major screenburn" probably gets the point across.

User: i like chronosomnia best

Bot: It's the most poetic. Chrono for time, somnia for sleep.

User: ur good at this

Bot: Words are fun to play with. Coming up with names for unnamed feelings is one of the better language games.

User: agreed. thanks for these

Bot: Use them freely. They're open source.
