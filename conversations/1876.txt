User: how do i factor x² + 7x + 12

Bot: (x + 3)(x + 4).

User: how

Bot: Find two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7. That's 3 and 4.

User: oh thats it?

Bot: For this type, yes. The numbers go in the factors.

User: what about x² - 5x + 6

Bot: (x - 2)(x - 3). Numbers multiply to 6, add to -5.

User: both negative?

Bot: Yes. When the last term is positive and middle is negative, both factors are negative.

User: what about x² + 2x - 15

Bot: (x + 5)(x - 3). Multiply to -15, add to 2.

User: so one positive one negative

Bot: Right. When the last term is negative, the factors have different signs.

User: this is actually clicking

Bot: Good! Factoring is just reverse FOIL. Once you see the pattern, it's mechanical.

User: thanks for the practice

Bot: Keep going. These become automatic with repetition.

User: i will

Bot: Good luck!
