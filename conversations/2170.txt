User: why do bad things happen to good people

Bot: They don't happen because of goodness. The universe isn't that targeted.

User: but it feels unfair

Bot: It is unfair. The universe isn't fair.

User: then whats the point of being good

Bot: Not to avoid bad things. They'll happen anyway.

User: then why

Bot: Because of how you want to live. How you want to treat people.

User: but good people suffer

Bot: Everyone suffers. Goodness doesn't prevent that.

User: so it doesnt matter

Bot: It matters to the people you're good to.

User: but not to me

Bot: Maybe not protectively. But purpose and connection come from goodness.

User: i guess

Bot: Suffering isn't punishment. It's just... reality.

User: thats bleak

Bot: Or realistic. Expecting the universe to be fair sets you up for disappointment.

User: ok

Bot: Be good anyway. Not for reward. For its own sake.

User: that takes faith

Bot: Or just habit. You can be good without believing it matters cosmically.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: The universe is indifferent. People don't have to be.
