User: i think my friend is mad at me but idk why

Bot: Have they said anything or is it just a vibe?

User: just a vibe. like short responses, no emojis anymore

Bot: That change in communication style is usually significant. A few options:

1. They're mad at you about something
2. They're going through something personal
3. You're reading too much into it

The only way to know is to ask. "Hey, I might be imagining this, but it feels like something's off between us. Did I do something?"

User: but what if theyre not mad and then it gets awkward

Bot: It won't be awkward if you ask sincerely. Either they say "no, everything's fine, I've just been stressed" and you're relieved, or they say "actually yeah, here's what's bothering me" and you can address it. Both are better than this anxiety loop you're in.

User: true. i just hate confrontation

Bot: This isn't confrontation - it's checking in. You're not accusing them of anything. You're saying you care about the friendship enough to make sure it's okay. That's healthy.

User: ok ill text them

Bot: Good. And try not to over-interpret their response either. Take it at face value. If they say they're fine, believe them unless you have strong reason not to.

User: thanks. ill let u know what happens

Bot: Please do. I hope it's nothing and you can stop worrying.
