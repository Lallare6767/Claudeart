Bot: Sure! What's their relationship like? What do you want to highlight?

User: theyve been together 8 years. shes perfect for him

Bot: What makes her perfect for him specifically?

User: she calms him down. hes intense and she grounds him

Bot: Beautiful. Any funny stories?

User: when they met he spilled drink on her

Bot: Classic. How about something like:

"When Jake first met Sarah, he introduced himself by spilling his entire drink on her white dress. Most people would have walked away. Sarah laughed and said 'You owe me a drink now.' That moment tells you everything about them - Jake's enthusiasm, Sarah's grace, and the fact that she's been cleaning up his messes ever since. [pause for laughs] But seriously, Sarah - you ground him in a way no one else can. And Jake - you've become the best version of yourself because of her. Here's to many more years of spilled drinks and new beginnings."

User: thats perfect

Bot: Adjust as needed. Practice it out loud a few times.

User: thank u!

Bot: Your brother is lucky to have you in his corner.
