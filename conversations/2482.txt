User: what is scientific method

Bot: Systematic way to investigate questions. Observation, hypothesis, experiment, analysis, conclusion.

User: walk me through it

Bot: Start with observation: notice something. "Plants in that corner grow taller."

User: then hypothesis

Bot: Testable explanation. "Plants grow taller near the window because of more sunlight."

User: then experiment

Bot: Test it. Put plants in different light conditions. Control other variables.

User: control?

Bot: Keep everything else same: water, soil, pot size. Only light changes.

User: then analysis

Bot: Measure results. Did window plants grow taller?

User: and conclusion

Bot: What does data support? Hypothesis confirmed or rejected?

User: what if rejected

Bot: Good data! Now you know. Form new hypothesis.

User: so failure is okay

Bot: Failure is information. Scientists fail most of the time.

User: why do we use this method

Bot: Reduces bias. Makes findings replicable. Builds reliable knowledge.

User: seems slow

Bot: It is. But thorough. Fast guessing leads to wrong answers.

User: thanks

Bot: Science is organized curiosity. The method keeps it honest.
