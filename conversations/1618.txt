User: what does depreciation mean

Bot: Decrease in value over time, usually for assets.

User: like what

Bot: A car. You buy it for $30,000, after 5 years it's worth $15,000. That $15,000 loss is depreciation.

User: why does it matter

Bot: For businesses, it's a tax deduction. For you, it affects buying decisions - some things lose value faster than others.

User: what depreciates fast

Bot: Cars, electronics, furniture. Anything new loses value the moment you buy it.

User: what holds value

Bot: Real estate usually, some watches, some cars (classic or rare), certain collectibles.

User: so i should buy used cars

Bot: Often yes. A new car loses 20% of value the first year. A 2-year-old car already took that hit.

User: what about houses

Bot: Houses usually appreciate - go up in value. That's why home ownership builds wealth.

User: so depreciation is bad

Bot: For assets you own, yes. But it's natural. Understanding it helps you make better financial decisions.

User: ok that makes sense

Bot: Good. It's one of those concepts that affects you even if you never use the word.

User: thanks for explaining!

Bot: Anytime.
