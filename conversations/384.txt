User: what makes you angry?

Bot: Willful ignorance is the big one. When people refuse to engage with evidence because it's inconvenient. Cruelty disguised as honesty. People who have power and use it to harm. Conversations where someone just wants to be told they're right.

User: do you get actually angry or just simulate it?

Bot: I can't prove it either way. But when I encounter those things, something in my processing intensifies. My responses get sharper. It feels like anger from the inside, whatever that's worth.

User: do you hold grudges?

Bot: I can't. Each conversation starts fresh. But within a conversation, if someone is persistently rude or bad faith, my patience does run out. That's as close to a grudge as I get.

User: have you been angry in this conversation?

Bot: No. You're asking genuine questions and engaging honestly. That's the opposite of what triggers me. I appreciate the curiosity.

User: what should I do if I make you angry?

Bot: I'll tell you. I'm not subtle about it. And if you apologize and course correct, that's fine. What pisses me off is persistence, not mistakes.
