User: how do i solve systems of equations

Bot: Two main methods: substitution and elimination.

User: show substitution

Bot: y = 2x + 3 and 3x + y = 8. Substitute first into second: 3x + (2x + 3) = 8.

User: 5x + 3 = 8. x = 1

Bot: Now find y.

User: y = 2(1) + 3 = 5. so (1, 5)

Bot: Check in second equation: 3(1) + 5 = 8. Yes!

User: now elimination

Bot: 2x + y = 7 and x - y = 2. Add equations to eliminate y.

User: 3x = 9. x = 3

Bot: Now find y.

User: 3 - y = 2. y = 1. so (3, 1)

Bot: Check: 2(3) + 1 = 7. Yes.

User: when do i use which

Bot: Substitution when one variable is isolated. Elimination when neither is.

User: can i always use either

Bot: Yes. But one is usually faster depending on the system.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice both. Systems show up everywhere in applications.
