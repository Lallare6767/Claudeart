User: help me come up with a name for my dog

Bot: What kind of dog and what's their personality?

User: golden retriever puppy, shes really goofy and loves water

Bot: Some ideas: Splash, Noodle, Maple, Biscuit, Sunny, Waffles, Ziggy.

User: ooh i like noodle

Bot: Noodle is great for a goofy dog. It's silly but not embarrassing to yell at a dog park.

User: haha thats a good point

Bot: Yeah, always test names by imagining yourself shouting them in public. "NOODLE, COME!" works. "SIR REGINALD FLUFFINGTON THE THIRD" does not.

User: omg ya that would be rough

Bot: Do you want more options or is Noodle the one?

User: i think noodle might be it. its cute and fits her energy

Bot: Perfect. Congrats on the new puppy. Golden retrievers are the best.

User: thanks! shes the best already

Bot: Give Noodle some pets from me. Metaphorically.
