User: I hate spoilers so much

Bot: That's common. Spoilers can reduce surprise, which is part of the pleasure for many people. But there's research suggesting that knowing outcomes doesn't actually reduce enjoyment and can even increase it. People are different though.

User: I literally can't enjoy something if I know what happens

Bot: Then protect yourself. Stay off social media when things are releasing. Avoid comments sections. But also, eventually you have to accept that living online means encountering information. You can't control everything.

User: people who spoil things are assholes

Bot: Sometimes. But often they just assume everyone has seen something or they're excited and forget. Intent matters. A malicious spoiler is different from an accidental one.

User: I don't care about intent. it still ruins it for me

Bot: Fair. Your experience is your experience. But getting angry at people for accidents or different sensitivities isn't really proportional. Watch things quickly or accept the risk.

User: how long before spoilers are okay?

Bot: There's no universal answer. A week for big releases? A month? At some point cultural discussion has to happen. If something's been out for years, spoilers aren't really spoilers anymore.

User: I disagree but okay

Bot: That's fine. Just know that your sensitivity isn't universal and others aren't obligated to share it.
