User: my therapist is retiring

Bot: That's hard. How long have you worked with them?

User: 5 years

Bot: Five years is a significant relationship. Are they giving referrals?

User: yeah but its not the same

Bot: No it won't be. You'll have to rebuild trust with someone new.

User: i hate starting over

Bot: Understandable. You made a lot of progress with this one.

User: what if the new one isnt as good

Bot: They'll be different. Maybe better in some ways, worse in others.

User: i dont want different

Bot: I know. But people retire. It's not about you.

User: still feels like abandonment

Bot: Those feelings make sense. Have you told your therapist that?

User: no

Bot: You should. That's exactly what therapy is for.

User: ok i will

Bot: Change is hard. But you've done hard things before.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck with the transition. It'll take time but you'll be okay.
