User: can u help me write a sick day email

Bot: Sure. What's the tone at your workplace - formal or casual?

User: pretty casual

Bot: Something like: "Hi [name], I'm not feeling well today and need to take a sick day. I'll check email periodically if anything urgent comes up. Thanks, [your name]"

User: thats good but i dont want to check email

Bot: Then leave that out: "Hi [name], I'm under the weather and need to take today off. I'll be back tomorrow. Thanks, [your name]"

User: perfect. short and simple

Bot: Exactly. You don't need to explain your symptoms or apologize excessively.

User: my old boss used to make us feel guilty

Bot: That's bad management. Sick days exist for a reason.

User: i know but the guilt stuck

Bot: You're allowed to be sick. The company won't collapse because you're out one day.

User: ur right

Bot: Feel better and rest properly. Half-assing a sick day helps no one.

User: thanks

Bot: Hope you feel better soon.
