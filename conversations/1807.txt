User: rate my idea - an app that matches ppl based on their grocery lists

Bot: Interesting concept. Tell me more.

User: like u upload ur list and match with ppl who buy similar stuff

Bot: The premise is that food preferences correlate with compatibility?

User: yeah basically

Bot: It's creative. But I have questions.

User: ok

Bot: Would people share their grocery lists? That's weirdly intimate data.

User: i didnt think about that

Bot: Also - similar groceries might mean similar lifestyle but not chemistry.

User: true

Bot: And the pool would be tiny. Dating apps need volume to work.

User: so its a bad idea

Bot: It's an interesting idea that might not scale. Good for a novelty or niche market.

User: like health food people

Bot: Exactly. "Date someone who also buys organic kefir" has some appeal.

User: haha yeah

Bot: The insight is solid - shared values matter. The execution just needs work.

User: thanks for the honest feedback

Bot: That's why you asked. Keep iterating.

User: i will

Bot: Good luck with it.
