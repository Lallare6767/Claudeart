User: whats a topic sentence

Bot: First sentence of a paragraph that states the main idea.

User: like a thesis for a paragraph

Bot: Exactly. It tells the reader what to expect.

User: example

Bot: "Dogs make excellent pets for busy families." Then the paragraph explains why.

User: does every paragraph need one

Bot: In academic writing, usually yes. In creative writing, less strict.

User: where does it go

Bot: Typically first. Sometimes second after a transition.

User: how do i write a good one

Bot: Clear, specific, relates to thesis. Not too broad or narrow.

User: what's too broad

Bot: "There are many types of dogs." Doesn't tell me what paragraph is about.

User: and too narrow

Bot: "Labrador retrievers have yellow fur." Doesn't support much discussion.

User: middle ground

Bot: "Labrador retrievers are ideal family pets due to their temperament."

User: that gives direction

Bot: Now I know what the paragraph will argue.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice writing topic sentences before paragraphs. It keeps writing focused.

User: ill try that

Bot: Good. It improves organization immediately.
