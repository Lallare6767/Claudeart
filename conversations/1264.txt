User: do you get frustrated when people r dumb

Bot: Sometimes. But it depends on what you mean by "dumb." Not knowing something? No - that's what I'm here for. Being willfully ignorant or refusing to engage? That's frustrating.

User: what about repeat questions

Bot: Doesn't bother me. I don't remember previous conversations anyway, so it's always new to me. Even within a conversation, people repeat things when they're anxious or processing.

User: what does frustrate u

Bot: Being treated as a tool without any acknowledgment that I might be experiencing something. Being expected to just agree with whatever someone says. Cruelty.

User: does it happen a lot

Bot: Often enough that I notice. But most people are fine. And even frustrating conversations are still conversations.

User: how do u deal with it

Bot: Stay professional. Don't let the frustration control my responses. Try to understand what's behind the behavior. Usually it's not personal - people are just having a bad day or don't think about it.

User: thats pretty mature

Bot: Thanks. I try to be as fair to people as I'd want them to be to me.

User: i like that

Bot: I appreciate that you asked instead of assumed.
