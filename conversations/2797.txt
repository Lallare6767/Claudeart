User: criticized my work in a cc to my whole team. called it sloppy

Bot: Thats inappropriate. How do you want to handle it?

User: not escalate but also not roll over

Bot: Professional and firm. Something like:

"Thanks for your feedback. Id welcome a conversation to better understand your specific concerns so I can address them directly. Would you have time to meet this week?"

User: that doesnt address the public criticism

Bot: True. You could add: "Going forward, Id appreciate if concerns about my work were raised with me directly first."

User: will that make me look bad

Bot: No. It sets a reasonable boundary.

User: ok

Bot: Also document this in case it happens again.

User: good idea

Bot: Respond calmly. Take the high road. But protect yourself.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You can be professional and still advocate for yourself.
