User: i dont like who im becoming

Bot: Who are you becoming?

User: bitter. cynical. closed off

Bot: When did it start?

User: after some bad experiences

Bot: So it's protective.

User: yeah but i dont want to stay this way

Bot: Good. Awareness is the first step.

User: how do i open up again

Bot: Slowly. With safe people. Risk a little at a time.

User: what if i get hurt again

Bot: You might. That's the price of being open.

User: not a great sales pitch

Bot: It's honest. But the alternative is staying bitter. Is that better?

User: no

Bot: Vulnerability is risk and reward. You can't have one without the other.

User: how do i tell whos safe

Bot: Consistent. Keep small confidences. Don't judge you.

User: ok

Bot: Start with small tests. Share something minor. See how they respond.

User: ok

Bot: You're not becoming someone else. You're protecting an injury. Injuries heal.

User: i hope so

Bot: They do. But you have to let them.
