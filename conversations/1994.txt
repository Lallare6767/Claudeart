Bot: "I'm sorry I yelled. I was frustrated but that's not an excuse. I shouldn't have raised my voice at you."

User: will they even understand

Bot: They'll understand more than you think. And they'll remember you apologized.

User: i feel like a bad parent

Bot: You're not. You're human. Bad parents don't feel guilty.

User: i dont want them to be scared of me

Bot: One incident won't do that. Patterns do. This isn't a pattern yet.

User: ok

Bot: After you apologize, also examine why you snapped. Stress? Lack of sleep?

User: both

Bot: Address those. You can't pour from an empty cup.

User: thanks

Bot: Go apologize. Then take care of yourself.
