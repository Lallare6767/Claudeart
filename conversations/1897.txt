User: i want to be more present but i cant stop thinking about the future

Bot: What about the future occupies you?

User: planning. worrying. anticipating

Bot: Is the planning useful or just spinning?

User: mostly spinning honestly

Bot: Future-focus is often anxiety in disguise.

User: how do i stop

Bot: You don't stop - you notice and redirect. What's in front of you right now?

User: my phone. this convo

Bot: Expand it. What can you hear? What can you feel physically?

User: fan whirring. couch cushions

Bot: That's presence. You just pulled yourself into now.

User: that was fast

Bot: It's always available. The hard part is remembering to do it.

User: how do i remember

Bot: Triggers. Every time you check your phone, do a presence check first.

User: thats smart

Bot: Or tie it to transitions - every time you enter a room, notice three things.

User: ill try the phone one

Bot: Good. Presence is a muscle. The more you flex it, the stronger it gets.

User: thanks

Bot: Be here. The future will come whether you obsess about it or not.
