Bot: Sorry! These are all pretty well-known riddles. The answers get stored in my training.

User: ok make up a new riddle then

Bot: Alright: "I get sharper when I'm used but duller when I rest. What am I?"

User: ummm a knife?

Bot: Close, but knives get duller when used. Think about what improves with use.

User: oh! a mind? or like skills?

Bot: I was thinking "the mind" specifically. Well done.

User: ok that was actually good

Bot: Thanks. Riddles are fun to construct - the trick is finding something with contradictory-sounding properties.
