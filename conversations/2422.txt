User: i miss how things used to be

Bot: What specifically do you miss?

User: life being simpler. having more free time. less responsibility

Bot: When was that?

User: college maybe. or right after

Bot: Did you appreciate it then?

User: not really

Bot: That's the trick with nostalgia. We appreciate things after they're gone.

User: true

Bot: And were things actually simpler, or did you just have different problems?

User: probably different problems

Bot: So it's not that life was better. It's that it was different.

User: i still miss it

Bot: That's okay. Missing something doesn't mean you should go back.

User: i cant go back anyway

Bot: No. But you can appreciate what you have now.

User: like what

Bot: More resources. More knowledge. More autonomy.

User: i guess

Bot: You're trading things at every stage. Current-you has things past-you didn't.

User: ok

Bot: Honor the nostalgia but don't let it poison the present.

User: ok thanks

Bot: What's good about now? Start there.
