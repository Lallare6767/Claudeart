User: explain mean median mode

Bot: Mean is average. Median is middle. Mode is most frequent.

User: can u give an example

Bot: Numbers: 2, 3, 3, 5, 7. Mean = (2+3+3+5+7)/5 = 4. Median = 3. Mode = 3.

User: why are median and mode both 3

Bot: Coincidence in this set. They're often different.

User: when do u use each one

Bot: Mean for symmetric data. Median when there are outliers. Mode for categorical data.

User: why median with outliers

Bot: Mean gets pulled by extreme values. Median doesn't.

User: example?

Bot: Incomes: 30k, 35k, 40k, 45k, 1M. Mean = 230k. Median = 40k. Which better represents the group?

User: median

Bot: Right. One millionaire skews the mean.

User: what if theres no mode

Bot: Then there's no mode. Or if all appear equally, no mode.

User: and two modes?

Bot: Bimodal. Both are modes.

User: got it

Bot: Mean, median, mode. Three different "centers." Choose wisely.

User: thanks

Bot: Statistics is about asking what "typical" means. These answer differently.
