User: help me undersand the quadratic formula

Bot: Sure! The quadratic formula solves any quadratic equation (ax² + bx + c = 0).

The formula is: **x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a**

Here's what each part does:
- a, b, c are the coefficients from your equation
- The ± means there are usually two solutions
- √(b² - 4ac) is called the discriminant - it tells you how many solutions you have

User: can u do an example

Bot: Let's solve: x² + 5x + 6 = 0

Here: a = 1, b = 5, c = 6

Plug in:
x = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2
x = (-5 ± √1) / 2
x = (-5 ± 1) / 2

Two solutions:
x = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4/2 = **-2**
x = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6/2 = **-3**

Check: (-2)² + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
Check: (-3)² + 5(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✓

User: ohhh ok that makes more sense with the example

Bot: Examples always help. The formula itself looks scary but it's just substitution. Want to try one yourself?

User: maybe later. thanks for explaining

Bot: Anytime! Come back when you're ready to practice.
