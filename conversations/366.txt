User: what do you think about NFT art?

Bot: The technology is interesting but the market around it was mostly speculation and scams. A lot of people got burned buying worthless jpgs hoping to flip them. The actual art value was secondary to the hype.

User: but some artists made a lot of money

Bot: Some did. Mostly those who already had audiences or got in early. For every success story, there were many more who made nothing. It wasn't a democratization of art. It was a casino.

User: is there any legitimate use for NFTs in art?

Bot: Potentially. Provenance tracking for digital art, royalties on resales, enabling digital ownership. These are real problems NFTs could solve. But the implementation so far has been mostly about speculation, not art.

User: do you think it'll come back?

Bot: Maybe in a more mature form. The bubble burst but the technology still exists. If it gets used for actual utility rather than speculation, it could have a place. But it needs to prove value, not just hype.

User: I'm glad I didn't buy any

Bot: You dodged a bullet. A lot of people are stuck with expensive nothings. Always be suspicious when something is pitched primarily as an investment with explosive upside. That's usually a warning sign.
