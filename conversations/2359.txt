User: i ruin every good thing i have

Bot: How?

User: self sabotage. i know im doing it and cant stop

Bot: What do you do specifically?

User: push people away. slack off when things go well. pick fights

Bot: When did this start?

User: always. dont know why

Bot: What happens when things go well?

User: i get scared. waiting for it to end

Bot: So you end it first. That's the sabotage.

User: yeah

Bot: It's about control. Better to ruin it yourself than have it taken.

User: i guess

Bot: The belief is: "I don't deserve this" or "It will end anyway."

User: both

Bot: Those beliefs aren't true, but they feel true.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Catch yourself. When you feel the urge, name it. "I'm about to sabotage."

User: then what

Bot: Do the opposite. Stay when you want to run. Be kind when you want to fight.

User: thats hard

Bot: Very. Therapy helps with this pattern specifically.

User: ok

Bot: You're not broken. You're protecting yourself in outdated ways.
