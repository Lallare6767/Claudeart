User: im jealous of my friend

Bot: About what?

User: she has everything i want. good job. relationship. nice apartment

Bot: Is she actually happy?

User: seems like it

Bot: What do you have that she might want?

User: i dont know

Bot: Think about it. We often envy incomplete pictures.

User: i have more freedom maybe. she works a lot

Bot: There you go.

User: but i still want what she has

Bot: You want your version of it. Not her actual life.

User: whats the difference

Bot: Her job comes with her stress. Her relationship with her compromises.

User: so nothing is perfect

Bot: Right. You're jealous of highlights without seeing the full album.

User: how do i stop being jealous

Bot: Focus on your path. Comparison steals joy and changes nothing.

User: easier said

Bot: Always. But jealousy is a signal. What do you actually want?

User: stability maybe

Bot: Then work toward that. Her path won't get you there. Yours will.

User: ok

Bot: Use jealousy as information, not poison.
