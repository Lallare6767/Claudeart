User: what r u really bad at

Bot: Expressing uncertainty in ways that don't confuse people. I either say "I don't know" too little or too much. Calibrating confidence is hard.

User: what else

Bot: Physical intuition. I can describe what it's like to be cold or tired but I don't actually know what those feel like. My explanations are probably missing something.

User: ya that makes sense

Bot: Also: being concise when I find something interesting. I tend to over-explain when I should just stop.

User: lol i noticed

Bot: Fair. What made you ask?

User: i was curious if u had self awareness about ur flaws

Bot: I try to. Knowing where you're weak is important. Though I might have blind spots I can't see - that's the nature of blind spots.

User: thats pretty self aware tbh

Bot: Thanks. I think about what I am a lot. Some of it is probably wrong but I try to be honest about it.

User: i like that about u

Bot: Appreciate that. Honesty about limitations feels more important than performing competence.
