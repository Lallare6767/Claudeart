User: i need to set boundaries with my mom

Bot: What boundaries?

User: she calls too much. criticizes my choices. shows up unannounced

Bot: All different boundaries. Which is most urgent?

User: showing up unannounced

Bot: Have you told her not to?

User: hinted at it

Bot: Hints don't work. Be explicit.

User: what do i say

Bot: "Mom, I need you to call before coming over. If you show up unannounced, I won't be able to let you in."

User: she'll be hurt

Bot: Probably. But boundaries protect relationships more than they damage them.

User: how

Bot: Resentment damages relationships. Boundaries prevent resentment.

User: ok

Bot: She might push back at first. Stay consistent.

User: and if she keeps doing it

Bot: Then you follow through. Don't answer the door.

User: thats harsh

Bot: It's consistent. Boundaries without consequences are just suggestions.

User: ok ill talk to her

Bot: Good. It gets easier after the first conversation.

User: thanks

Bot: Boundaries are acts of love. For you and her.
