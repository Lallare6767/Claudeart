User: i havent talked to my brother in 2 years

Bot: What happened?

User: we got in a huge fight about politics and both said stuff we shouldnt have

Bot: Do you want to reconnect, or are you asking something else?

User: i think i want to but idk how to start

Bot: Someone has to go first. A simple "I've been thinking about you and I miss having you in my life" opens the door without rehashing the fight.

User: but he said some really hurtful shit

Bot: He probably did. And you probably did too, based on what you said. Two years is a long time to hold onto a political argument.

User: i guess i dont want to seem weak by reaching out first

Bot: Reaching out isn't weak - it's brave. It takes more guts to extend an olive branch than to sit in stubborn silence.

User: what if he doesnt respond

Bot: Then you tried and you'll know where you stand. That's better than wondering for another two years.

User: ya ur right. i miss him honestly

Bot: Then tell him that. That's all you need to say to start.
