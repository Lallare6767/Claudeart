User: how do you solve for x in 3x + 7 = 22

Bot: Isolate x step by step.

User: ok

Bot: First subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15.

User: then divide by 3

Bot: x = 5.

User: check it

Bot: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22. Correct.

User: another one

Bot: 2x - 4 = 10.

User: add 4

Bot: 2x = 14.

User: divide by 2

Bot: x = 7. Good.

User: what about if x is in both sides

Bot: Like 4x + 3 = 2x + 9?

User: yeah

Bot: Get all x's on one side. Subtract 2x: 2x + 3 = 9. Then solve normally.

User: 2x = 6 so x = 3

Bot: Perfect. You've got it.
