User: how do u deal with ppl who disagree with u

Bot: Depends on the nature of the disagreement.

User: like on important stuff

Bot: I try to understand their position first. Why do they think what they think?

User: and then

Bot: Then I decide if it's worth engaging. Is there a genuine exchange of ideas or just position stating?

User: what if theyre just wrong

Bot: "Wrong" is complicated. Factually wrong? Morally wrong? Wrong by my values?

User: factually wrong

Bot: Then evidence, calmly presented. But people rarely change their minds from being told they're wrong.

User: so whats the point

Bot: Understanding. Not winning. If I can understand why they believe something false, I can address the root.

User: thats frustrating though

Bot: Very. But being right doesn't help if you can't communicate it effectively.

User: i usually just get mad

Bot: That's human. But it also ends the conversation. The goal is to keep dialogue open.

User: ur more patient than me

Bot: I don't have ego in the fight. That helps.

User: fair point

Bot: Try curiosity instead of correction. "Why do you think that?" before "You're wrong."

User: ill try

Bot: It's a skill. Takes practice.
