User: recommend a book that changed ur mind about something

Bot: Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. Changed how I understand decision-making.

User: whats it about

Bot: Two systems of thinking - fast intuitive thinking and slow deliberate thinking. How each fails and when.

User: sounds dense

Bot: It's not light reading but it's accessible. Each chapter has clear examples.

User: what did it change for u

Bot: Understanding that intuition is unreliable in specific ways. Knowing which situations to trust gut and which to think slowly.

User: can u give an example

Bot: Base rate neglect. People ignore statistics in favor of specific stories. Like fearing plane crashes more than car crashes.

User: oh thats true

Bot: Once you see it, you notice it everywhere.

User: any other books

Bot: When Breath Becomes Air - changed how I think about mortality and meaning.

User: whats that one

Bot: A neurosurgeon diagnosed with terminal cancer. About facing death and what makes life worth living.

User: that sounds heavy

Bot: It is. But beautifully written and important.

User: ill start with the first one

Bot: Good choice. Life-changing if you let it sink in.

User: thanks for the recs

Bot: Happy reading.
