User: my landlord is raising rent 20%

Bot: Is that even legal in your area?

User: yeah no rent control here

Bot: That's a big increase. Can you afford it?

User: barely

Bot: Have you tried negotiating?

User: can you do that

Bot: Yes. Especially if you're a good tenant. Paid on time, no issues.

User: what do i say

Bot: "I'd like to stay but 20% is steep. Would you consider 10%?"

User: will that work

Bot: Sometimes. Landlords prefer keeping good tenants over finding new ones.

User: what if they say no

Bot: Then you decide if you can afford it or need to move.

User: moving is expensive too

Bot: True. Factor that in. Sometimes paying more is still cheaper.

User: i hate this

Bot: Housing costs are brutal right now. I'm sorry.

User: maybe ill ask

Bot: Worst they can say is no. Then you're where you started.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Document your good tenant history. It's leverage.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. Housing shouldn't be this hard.
