User: i need to have a hard conversation with my partner

Bot: What about?

User: they need to get help for their mental health. theyre not functioning

Bot: That's a tough but important conversation. How long has this been going on?

User: months. theyre not working, not leaving the house, barely showering

Bot: What have they said about it?

User: they know somethings wrong but keep saying theyll handle it

Bot: They're not handling it. You're going to have to be direct.

User: i dont want to be mean

Bot: Direct isn't mean. Letting them decline while saying nothing - that's not kind either.

User: what do i say

Bot: Something like: "I love you and I'm worried about you. I need you to see a doctor this week. I'll help you make the appointment but this has to happen."

User: what if they refuse

Bot: Then you have to decide what your boundary is. You can't force them but you can be clear about what you need.

User: like an ultimatum?

Bot: More like clarity. "I can't keep watching you suffer without help. If you won't get help, I need to think about what that means for us."

User: that's scary

Bot: It is. But the current situation isn't sustainable.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck. This is hard but necessary.
