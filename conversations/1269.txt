User: i think i have imposter syndrome

Bot: What makes you feel like an imposter?

User: like i got lucky and everyone will figure out im not that smart

Bot: How long have you been in your position?

User: 2 years

Bot: And you haven't been fired. You've presumably gotten positive feedback. So the evidence says you're competent, but the feeling says you're not.

User: exactly

Bot: Imposter syndrome disproportionately affects competent people. The less competent often don't question themselves at all. Your doubt is actually correlated with ability.

User: that seems backwards

Bot: It is. But it's well-documented. The more you know, the more you know you don't know. That creates doubt.

User: so how do i fix it

Bot: Notice when the feeling comes and challenge it with evidence. "I feel like a fraud" vs "I've been here two years, got promoted, people rely on me." The evidence is real. The feeling is just a feeling.

User: it doesnt feel like just a feeling

Bot: Because feelings are compelling. But they're not always accurate. Keep a list of your accomplishments and look at it when the imposter feelings hit.

User: ok ill try that

Bot: Also: talk to peers. You'll find out most of them feel the same way. It helps to know you're not alone.
