User: what should i name my plant

Bot: What kind of plant is it?

User: a monstera. big one with lots of splits

Bot: Some options: Fern Gully (even though it's not a fern), Phil (short for philodendron family), Monstera Mia, or just a human name like Harold.

User: harold lmaooo

Bot: There's something funny about plants with formal human names. "Have you met Harold? He needs indirect light."

User: ok now serious options

Bot: Morgan, Verde, Leafy, Monty (for monstera), Ivy (classic plant name), or something that matches your aesthetic.

User: i like monty

Bot: Monty the Monstera. It works.

User: monty it is. thanks for the naming session

Bot: Enjoy your plant. Monsterasare great - hard to kill and very dramatic when they get big.

User: ya i love watching new leaves unfurl

Bot: That's the best part. Very satisfying growth to observe.

User: ok gonna go water monty

Bot: Tell Monty I said hi.
