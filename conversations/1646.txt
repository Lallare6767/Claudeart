User: can u explain what NFTs were about

Bot: "Were" is accurate - the hype crashed. Basically: NFTs are tokens that prove ownership of a digital item on a blockchain.

User: so u own the picture?

Bot: Not quite. You own a token that points to the picture. The picture itself can still be copied by anyone.

User: then what's the point

Bot: Provable scarcity and ownership. Like owning an original painting - anyone can have a print but you have THE one.

User: did that work

Bot: For some people during the boom - rare collectibles sold for millions. Then the market crashed 90%+.

User: so it was a bubble

Bot: Largely yes. Some legitimate uses for artists and collectibles but most were speculation and hype.

User: why did people pay so much

Bot: FOMO, speculation, money laundering in some cases, genuine belief in some cases. Bubbles are psychological as much as financial.

User: did anyone make money

Bot: Early buyers and creators did. Most late buyers lost everything.

User: classic

Bot: Classic bubble pattern. Tulips, beanie babies, NFTs. Same psychology, different object.

User: thanks for explaining

Bot: It's a good cautionary tale about hype-driven markets.
