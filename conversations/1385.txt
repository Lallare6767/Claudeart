User: what is 3/4 divided by 1/2

Bot: 3/2 or 1.5.

User: how

Bot: When you divide fractions, you multiply by the reciprocal. So (3/4) ÷ (1/2) = (3/4) × (2/1) = 6/4 = 3/2.

User: oh right flip and multiply

Bot: Exactly. That shortcut works for any fraction division.

User: ok what about 5/6 divided by 2/3

Bot: (5/6) × (3/2) = 15/12 = 5/4 = 1.25.

User: can u simplify before multiplying

Bot: Yes, that's actually easier. 5/6 × 3/2 - the 6 and 3 share a factor of 3, so: 5/2 × 1/2 = 5/4.

User: wait how did u cancel

Bot: 6 ÷ 3 = 2 and 3 ÷ 3 = 1. So 5/6 × 3/2 becomes 5/2 × 1/2. Same answer, easier numbers.

User: ohh cross canceling

Bot: Right. Always look for common factors between numerators and denominators before multiplying.

User: that helps a lot thanks

Bot: Anytime. Fractions are easier once you see the patterns.
