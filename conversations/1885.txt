User: do u think technology makes us happier

Bot: Mixed evidence. It solves problems and creates new ones.

User: like what problems does it create

Bot: Distraction, comparison, shorter attention spans, isolation disguised as connection.

User: but also good stuff

Bot: Medical advances, information access, genuine connection across distances.

User: so its neutral

Bot: The technology is neutral. How we use it determines outcomes.

User: i spend too much time on my phone

Bot: Most people do. The apps are designed for engagement, not wellbeing.

User: how do i use it better

Bot: Be intentional. Set time limits. Turn off notifications. Ask what you're getting from it.

User: probably just avoiding boredom

Bot: Boredom is underrated. It's where creativity and self-reflection happen.

User: i used to be better at boredom

Bot: Before the phone. You can relearn.

User: by putting it down

Bot: Yes. It'll feel uncomfortable at first. That's withdrawal from stimulation.

User: that sounds dramatic

Bot: It's real though. The discomfort passes. Then you can think again.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Even an hour a day phone-free is a start.

User: thanks

Bot: Take back your attention. It's yours.
