User: i think i need to quit my job

Bot: What's prompting this?

User: i dread going in every day. been like this for months

Bot: What specifically do you dread?

User: everything. the work, the people, the environment

Bot: That's comprehensive. Do you have savings?

User: some. maybe 3 months

Bot: Are you looking for other jobs while employed?

User: casually

Bot: Ramp it up. It's easier to find work while you have work.

User: what if i just quit without anything lined up

Bot: Risky. 3 months goes fast, and gaps are harder to explain.

User: im so tired though

Bot: I hear you. But strategic is better than impulsive here.

User: so i should wait

Bot: Apply aggressively for the next month. If nothing comes and you're truly at breaking point, then consider quitting.

User: what if my mental health suffers

Bot: That matters. But unemployment can also harm mental health. Balance both.

User: ok ill try harder to find something first

Bot: Good plan. Targeted applications, network, update your resume today.

User: thanks for the reality check

Bot: You deserve better than dread. Go get it strategically.
