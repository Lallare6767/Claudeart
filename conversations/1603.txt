User: whats 2/3 + 3/4

Bot: 17/12 or 1 5/12.

User: how

Bot: Find common denominator: 12. Convert: 2/3 = 8/12, 3/4 = 9/12. Add: 8+9 = 17/12.

User: and to subtract 5/6 - 1/4

Bot: Common denominator: 12. 5/6 = 10/12, 1/4 = 3/12. Subtract: 10-3 = 7/12.

User: why is it always 12

Bot: Because 12 is a common multiple of 3, 4, and 6. It's often the LCM in these problems.

User: what about 2/7 + 3/5

Bot: Common denominator: 35. 2/7 = 10/35, 3/5 = 21/35. Add: 31/35.

User: how did u know 35

Bot: 7 and 5 are both prime and don't share factors, so LCM is just 7×5 = 35.

User: what if denominators share factors

Bot: Then LCM is smaller. 1/6 + 1/4: LCM is 12 not 24, because 6 and 4 share a factor of 2.

User: ok this is clicking

Bot: Good. The common denominator is the key skill. Once you have that, adding is easy.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing.
