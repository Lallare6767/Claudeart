User: how do u factor trinomials

Bot: For x² + bx + c, find two numbers that multiply to c and add to b.

User: example

Bot: x² + 5x + 6. What multiplies to 6 and adds to 5?

User: 2 and 3

Bot: So (x + 2)(x + 3).

User: let me try. x² + 7x + 12

Bot: Go ahead.

User: multiply to 12, add to 7. 3 and 4. so (x + 3)(x + 4)

Bot: Perfect. Check by FOILing.

User: x² + 4x + 3x + 12 = x² + 7x + 12. yes!

Bot: What about x² - 2x - 8

Bot: Now one number is negative.

User: multiply to -8, add to -2. um. -4 and 2?

Bot: Check: -4 × 2 = -8. -4 + 2 = -2. Yes!

User: so (x - 4)(x + 2)

Bot: Good. What if leading coefficient isn't 1?

User: like 2x²?

Bot: That's harder. Different methods. AC method or grouping.

User: for later

Bot: Yes. Master these first.

User: thanks

Bot: Factoring is reverse FOIL. Practice until it's fast.
