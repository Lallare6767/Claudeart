User: help me with word problems

Bot: Sure! Give me one.

User: a train leaves at 9am going 60mph. another leaves at 10am going 80mph. when does the second catch up

Bot: Good one. When they meet, they've traveled equal distances.

User: ok

Bot: First train: distance = 60t (where t is hours after 9am). Second train: distance = 80(t-1) since it starts 1 hour later.

User: so 60t = 80(t-1)

Bot: Exactly. Solve it.

User: 60t = 80t - 80

Bot: Keep going.

User: -20t = -80

Bot: So?

User: t = 4

Bot: 4 hours after 9am = 1pm. They meet at 1pm.

User: how far

Bot: 60 × 4 = 240 miles from start.

User: or 80 × 3

Bot: Same answer. Good check.

User: these are actually fun

Bot: Word problems are just translation exercises. Words to equations.

User: thanks!

Bot: Practice more. The patterns repeat.
