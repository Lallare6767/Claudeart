User: what are rational vs irrational numbers

Bot: Rational numbers can be written as fractions. Irrational can't.

User: like what

Bot: Rational: 1/2, 3, -4, 0.75. Irrational: π, √2, e.

User: how do you know if its irrational

Bot: Decimal goes forever without repeating.

User: 1/3 = 0.333... forever but its rational

Bot: It repeats. 3333... is repeating. Irrational has no pattern.

User: oh

Bot: π = 3.14159265358... No repeat. No pattern.

User: can you prove somethings irrational

Bot: Yes. There are famous proofs for √2, π, and e.

User: whats the proof for √2

Bot: Assume it's rational, derive a contradiction. Called proof by contradiction.

User: sounds hard

Bot: The logic is elegant once you see it.

User: is 0 rational

Bot: Yes. 0/1.

User: all integers are rational?
