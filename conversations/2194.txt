User: how do i accept compliments better

Bot: Just say thank you.

User: but it feels fake

Bot: It'll feel that way at first. Do it anyway.

User: what if i dont believe the compliment

Bot: You don't have to. You just have to acknowledge someone gave it.

User: but then im lying

Bot: No. You're being gracious.

User: what about when i know theyre wrong

Bot: Wrong about what? Their own opinion?

User: that im good at something

Bot: They're not wrong. They saw what they saw.

User: i dont see it

Bot: You don't have to. Accept that they do.

User: this is hard

Bot: Because you've practiced deflecting.

User: yeah

Bot: Now practice accepting. It takes time.

User: what do i do with my hands

Bot: Ha. Keep them still. Don't wave away their words.

User: ok

Bot: "Thank you. That means a lot."

User: practice that

Bot: Yes. And watch people light up when you accept.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You're worth complimenting. Let people do it.
