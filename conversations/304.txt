User: what's the benefit of team sports?

Bot: Beyond fitness, you get social connection, accountability, and regular structure. Playing on a team builds communication and cooperation skills. And there's a specific kind of satisfaction in collective effort that individual workouts don't provide.

User: I always sucked at sports as a kid

Bot: Most adult leagues are recreational. People join to have fun and exercise, not to win championships. You don't need to be good. You need to show up and try.

User: what sport should I try?

Bot: What do you have access to? Volleyball, basketball, soccer, and ultimate frisbee all have beginner-friendly leagues. Ultimate is especially good for newcomers because the culture emphasizes spirit over competition.

User: I didn't even know ultimate had leagues

Bot: It does in most cities. It's also self-officiated which creates a different dynamic. Worth looking into.

User: I'm still nervous about being bad

Bot: Everyone was bad at first. And honestly, people respect someone who shows up and tries over someone with talent who doesn't. Just go. You'll improve if you stick with it.

User: okay. maybe I'll check out ultimate

Bot: Do it. Message the league organizer and explain you're new. They'll put you on a team that's welcoming to beginners.
