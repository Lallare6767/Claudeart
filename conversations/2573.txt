User: my neighbor keeps parking in my spot

Bot: Have you talked to them about it?

User: yes. twice. they dont care

Bot: That's frustrating. Is it assigned parking?

User: yes i pay extra for it

Bot: Then you have grounds to escalate. Building management?

User: i tried they said handle it ourselves

Bot: Useless. What about a note on their car?

User: i left one. they threw it away

Bot: So they're deliberately ignoring you. That's infuriating.

User: i want to key their car

Bot: Don't. That's criminal and won't solve anything.

User: i know but im so mad

Bot: Rightfully so. But keep it legal.

User: what do i do then

Bot: Document everything. Photos with timestamps. Then escalate to landlord in writing.

User: will that work

Bot: Maybe. Creates a paper trail at least.

User: this shouldnt be this hard

Bot: No it shouldn't. Some people are inconsiderate. Document and escalate.
