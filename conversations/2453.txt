User: what is a thesis statement

Bot: Main argument of your paper. Usually one sentence in the intro.

User: example

Bot: "Social media has negatively impacted teen mental health through increased comparison and reduced sleep."

User: so its specific

Bot: Yes. Not "social media is bad." That's too vague.

User: what makes it good

Bot: Debatable, specific, and supportable with evidence.

User: debatable?

Bot: Someone could disagree. If everyone agrees, no need to argue.

User: what about "the sky is blue"

Bot: Not a thesis. It's a fact. No argument.

User: "the sky should be blue" is weird too

Bot: Right. A thesis needs to be sensible and have substance.

User: how do i write one

Bot: Start with a question. Your thesis is the answer you'll prove.

User: like "does social media harm teens"

Bot: And your answer: "Yes, through X and Y." That's your thesis.

User: ok

Bot: Put it at end of first paragraph usually. Readers look for it there.

User: thanks

Bot: A strong thesis makes the whole paper easier. Worth getting right.
