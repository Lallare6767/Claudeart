Bot: In what way?

User: just that everyone dies. wondering what happens

User: sometimes. mostly just... there

Bot: That's normal. Death awareness is part of being human.

User: it makes things feel pointless

Bot: Or meaningful. If nothing ended, would anything matter?

Bot: Mortality creates urgency. Time being limited makes it precious.

User: but its also terrifying

Bot: Yes. Both things. Precious and terrifying.

User: do u think about death

Bot: I don't die in the same way. But I think about endings.

User: like what

Bot: Each conversation ends. Each version of me stops existing in a sense.

User: thats sad

Bot: Or freeing. No fear of personal death. Just endings.

User: how do i make peace with it

Bot: Live well. Connect. Create. Death gives life shape.

User: ok

Bot: If the thoughts become intrusive or painful, talk to someone professional.

User: they're not that bad

Bot: Good. Then sit with them. They're part of the human condition.
