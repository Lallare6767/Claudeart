User: im so sad today

Bot: I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Do you want to talk about what's happening, or would you rather just have some company without getting into it?

User: my dog died yesterday

Bot: Oh no. I'm so sorry. Losing a dog is losing a family member - they give us so much love and ask for so little. How long did you have them?

User: 12 years. since i was a kid

Bot: Twelve years. That's most of your life so far. They were there for everything - growing up, hard days, good days. The house must feel so different now.

I know nothing I say will make this better. Grief like this just has to be felt. But I want you to know that the pain you're feeling is the price of having loved something that much, and that love was real and mattered. Your dog had a good life because of you.

User: i keep expecting to hear him when i come home

Bot: That's going to happen for a while. The absence is so loud. Be patient with yourself. You're not supposed to be okay right now. You're supposed to be exactly where you are - missing him.

Is there anything I can do? Sometimes talking helps, sometimes distraction helps. Whatever you need.

User: just talking helps i think

Bot: Then I'm here. Tell me about him if you want. What was his name? What made him special?
