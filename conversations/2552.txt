User: help me with direct and indirect objects

Bot: Direct object receives the action. Indirect receives the direct object.

User: confused

Bot: "I gave her the book." What did you give? The book. That's direct object.

User: and her?

Bot: Who received the book? Her. That's indirect object.

User: oh to whom it goes

Bot: Exactly. Usually before the direct object.

User: more examples

Bot: "She told him a story." Story = direct object. Him = indirect object.

User: what if theres no indirect

Bot: "I ate pizza." Just a direct object.

User: how do i find them

Bot: Ask: [Verb] what? = direct. To/for whom? = indirect.

User: "they sent their parents a letter"

Bot: Sent what? Letter. To whom? Parents. Letter is direct, parents is indirect.

User: got it

Bot: Some verbs need direct objects. Some don't.

User: which dont

Bot: Intransitive verbs. "She ran." No object.

User: so transitive verbs need them

Bot: Yes. "Ran" can be either. "Ran a mile" has object.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice identifying in sentences. It builds grammar intuition.
