User: today is my birthday and i feel kinda sad

Bot: I'm sorry. What's making you sad?

User: idk i feel like its supposed to be special but its just another day

Bot: Birthdays have a lot of pressure to be significant. But most of the time they're just regular days with expectations attached.

User: ya and i feel like i should be further along by now

Bot: Further along in what?

User: just life i guess. career, relationship, all of it

Bot: Birthdays do that - they make you take inventory. But the milestones you're comparing yourself to are often arbitrary. Where you "should" be by a certain age is made up.

User: i guess i just feel behind

Bot: Behind who? Everyone's timeline is different. Comparing yourself to some imaginary standard is just guaranteed disappointment.

User: ya ur right. im still sad tho

Bot: That's okay. You can know the logic and still feel the feeling. Be sad today if you need to be. But also: happy birthday. You made it another year. That's worth something.

User: thanks. this actually helped

Bot: I hope the rest of the day gets better. And next year you can just treat it like a regular day if that feels better.
