User: whats the difference between who and whom

Bot: Who is subject. Whom is object.

User: i dont know what that means

Bot: Who does the action. Whom receives it.

User: example

Bot: "Who ate my sandwich?" Who is doing the eating.

User: and whom

Bot: "To whom did you give my sandwich?" The sandwich was given to whom.

User: how do i remember

Bot: Replace with he/him. If him works, use whom.

User: so "give it to him" = whom

Bot: Yes. "Him" is object, so "whom."

User: "he ate it" = who

Bot: Exactly. "He" is subject, so "who."

User: what about "who/whom should I call"

Bot: "Should I call him." Him works. So "whom should I call."

User: wow that trick is great

Bot: Works every time. He/who. Him/whom.

User: is "whom" dying out

Bot: Somewhat. Especially in casual speech. But good to know for formal writing.

User: thanks

Bot: You'll impress people using "whom" correctly. Few do.
