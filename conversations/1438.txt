User: i feel like im always waiting for life to start

Bot: What does "starting" look like to you?

User: idk. feeling like im actually living not just going through motions

Bot: What are you waiting for specifically? A job, relationship, place?

User: i keep thinking when i get x then ill feel happy

Bot: That's the "arrival fallacy." The idea that once you reach a goal, you'll finally be happy. But people hit goals and still feel the same.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Two things work: either find meaning in the process, not just the outcome, or examine whether those goals are actually what you want or what you think you should want.

User: what do u mean

Bot: Are you chasing things because they matter to you, or because you think they'll make you feel legitimate?

User: probably the second tbh

Bot: Then hitting them won't satisfy you. The problem isn't the goal - it's the underlying feeling of not being enough.

User: how do i fix that

Bot: That's therapy territory. But awareness is step one. Noticing "I'm chasing this to feel good enough" lets you question it.

User: i probably should talk to someone

Bot: It helps. You deserve to feel like your life has started already.
