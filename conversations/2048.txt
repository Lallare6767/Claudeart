User: whats derivative of e^x

Bot: e^x. It's its own derivative.

User: thats weird

Bot: It's beautiful. That's what makes e special.

User: what about e^(2x)

Bot: 2e^(2x). Chain rule.

User: and e^(-x)

Bot: -e^(-x).

User: what about 3e^x

Bot: 3e^x. Constant just comes along.

User: and e^(x²)

Bot: 2xe^(x²). Derivative of inside times e to that power.

User: these are fun

Bot: Exponentials with e are the easiest derivatives.

User: why is e that number

Bot: e is the base where the slope equals the value. It emerges naturally from growth.

User: 2.71 something

Bot: 2.71828... It's irrational, like π.

User: math is wild

Bot: e appears everywhere. Compound interest, probability, calculus.

User: ok thanks!

Bot: Remember: e^x is its own derivative. Most beautiful fact in calculus.
