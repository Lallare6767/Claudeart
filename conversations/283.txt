User: do you play chess?

Bot: I understand chess deeply but I don't play in the human sense. I can analyze positions and explain concepts. Are you learning or do you play seriously?

User: I'm trying to get better but I'm stuck around 1200

Bot: That's a common plateau. What's your biggest weakness? Tactics, openings, endgames?

User: I think tactics. I miss stuff all the time

Bot: Then you need puzzles. A lot of puzzles. Lichess and Chess.com both have puzzle trainers. Do them daily. 1200 to 1400 is mostly about pattern recognition, seeing forks, pins, skewers instantly instead of missing them.

User: how many puzzles should I do a day?

Bot: At least 10-20. Quality matters more than quantity. When you get one wrong, don't just move on. Understand why. Replay it. See the pattern. That's how you internalize it.

User: what about openings?

Bot: At 1200, openings barely matter. If you're spending time memorizing lines, stop. Learn a few basic principles: control the center, develop pieces, castle early. That's enough. Your games are decided by tactics, not opening theory.

User: okay that's actually a relief

Bot: Openings are where amateurs waste the most time. Get to 1600 on tactics and endgames, then worry about opening preparation.
