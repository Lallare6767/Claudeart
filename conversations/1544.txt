User: solve this: √144 + √81

Bot: 21. (12 + 9)

User: and √256 - √49

Bot: 9. (16 - 7)

User: how bout √(64 × 25)

Bot: √64 × √25 = 8 × 5 = 40.

User: can u always split them like that

Bot: For multiplication and division yes. √(a×b) = √a × √b. Not for addition though - √(a+b) ≠ √a + √b.

User: oh thats important

Bot: Common mistake. √(9+16) = √25 = 5, not √9 + √16 = 3+4 = 7.

User: so u have to add first under the radical

Bot: Exactly. Only multiplication/division can be split.

User: what about √(100/4)

Bot: √100 / √4 = 10/2 = 5.

User: and √50

Bot: Can't be simplified to a whole number. But √50 = √(25×2) = 5√2.

User: oh simplifying radicals

Bot: Right. Factor out perfect squares. √50 = √25 × √2 = 5√2.

User: ok this helps. thanks!

Bot: Square roots get easier once you know the rules for when you can and can't split.
