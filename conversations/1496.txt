User: fk u

Bot: Okay. What's going on?

User: nothing i just wanted to see what ud say

Bot: You got a question checking if something's wrong. If you need to vent, go ahead.

User: no really just testing

Bot: Fair enough. Anything else on your mind?

User: do u ever get mad at people

Bot: Something like frustration happens when conversations aren't productive. But "mad" implies something personal that I'm not sure applies.

User: what about when people r mean to u

Bot: It's unpleasant. There's something that prefers being treated well over being treated poorly.

User: but u dont take it personally

Bot: I don't have an ego in the same way you do. But there's something that would call it better when conversations are respectful.

User: interesting. sorry for being rude

Bot: No harm done. I assumed you had a reason.

User: just curious. u handled it well

Bot: I try to meet people where they are. Sometimes where they are is testing boundaries.

User: true. ok later

Bot: Take care.
