User: whats 3/8 as a decimal

Bot: 0.375.

User: and as a percent

Bot: 37.5%.

User: what about 5/6

Bot: 0.8333... repeating, or about 83.3%.

User: why does that one repeat

Bot: Because 6 doesn't divide evenly into 10 or 100. It creates an infinite decimal.

User: oh interesting

Bot: Fractions with denominators containing only 2s and 5s terminate. Others repeat.

User: so 1/4 terminates because 4 is 2 squared

Bot: Exactly! 1/4 = 0.25.

User: but 1/3 repeats

Bot: Yes, 0.333... because 3 isn't made of 2s and 5s.

User: this is actually making sense

Bot: Once you see the pattern, it's easy to predict.

User: whats 7/8 as decimal

Bot: 0.875. 8 is 2³ so it terminates.

User: im getting it

Bot: Good! Fractions are just division written differently.

User: thanks for explaining

Bot: Numbers are more logical than they seem. Keep practicing.
