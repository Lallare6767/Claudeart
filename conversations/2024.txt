User: solve 2x + 5 = 13

Bot: 2x = 8, so x = 4.

User: what about 3x - 7 = 14

Bot: 3x = 21, so x = 7.

User: now 5x + 3 = 2x + 12

Bot: Move x terms together: 5x - 2x = 12 - 3, so 3x = 9, x = 3.

User: what about fractions

Bot: Sure. Solve (x/2) + 3 = 7.

User: x/2 = 4 so x = 8

Bot: Perfect. What about (2x + 1)/3 = 5?

User: umm multiply by 3... 2x + 1 = 15

Bot: Then?

User: 2x = 14 so x = 7

Bot: Excellent. You've got this.

User: these arent too hard

Bot: Linear equations are just moving things around until x is alone.

User: i like that way of thinking

Bot: It's all just balance. What you do to one side, do to the other.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing. Speed comes with repetition.
