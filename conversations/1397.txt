User: how do i tell if a source is reliable

Bot: Look at: who wrote it, who published it, when it was published, whether they cite their sources, and whether other reliable sources say similar things.

User: what counts as reliable sources

Bot: Academic journals, established news outlets (especially with fact-checking processes), government data, reputable institutions. Not random blogs or social media.

User: what about wikipedia

Bot: Good for general understanding and finding primary sources, but don't cite Wikipedia itself. Check their citations and go to the original source.

User: my teacher says no wikipedia

Bot: Common rule. Use Wikipedia to learn and find real sources, then cite those.

User: how do i know if news is biased

Bot: All news has some bias, but there's a difference between bias and unreliability. Check if they separate news from opinion, if they correct errors, if they use multiple sources.

User: what about sites i never heard of

Bot: Be skeptical. Check their "About" page, look them up on fact-checking sites, see if established outlets cite them. Unknown doesn't mean bad but it means verify.

User: this is harder than just googling

Bot: Yes, but googling isn't research. Anyone can put anything online.

User: ok fair point

Bot: Information literacy takes effort but it's worth developing.
