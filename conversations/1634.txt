User: my neighbor keeps complaining about noise but im not loud

Bot: What are they complaining about specifically?

User: walking around, cooking, just living

Bot: What kind of building is it?

User: old apartment. wood floors

Bot: Sound travels in old buildings. They might genuinely hear everything.

User: but thats not my fault

Bot: No, it's bad construction. But you're both stuck with it.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Some things help: area rugs on hard floors, felt pads on furniture, being mindful during quiet hours.

User: i already have rugs

Bot: Then you're doing what you can. Have you talked to them?

User: they just complain. we havent talked solutions

Bot: Try: "I understand the noise is frustrating. Here's what I've done - rugs, pads. What times are most important for you?"

User: what if theyre unreasonable

Bot: Then document and involve landlord. But try good faith conversation first.

User: ok. ill talk to them

Bot: Approach it as neighbors with a shared problem, not adversaries. That framing helps.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck. Hopefully they're reasonable once you engage.
