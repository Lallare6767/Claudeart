User: short. like 2 minutes

Bot: Good length. What do you want to hit?

User: something funny, something sweet, then congratulations

Bot: Perfect structure. What's a funny story about your brother?

User: when he was 10 he swore hed never get married because girls were gross

Bot: Great. And what made him change his mind about his partner?

User: she calls him out. but also believes in him

Bot: That's the sweet part. Here's a framework:

User: ok

Bot: "Growing up, [Brother] swore he'd never get married. Girls were gross, he said. Then he met [Partner]. And I watched my stubborn brother become someone who couldn't stop talking about this amazing person. Someone who challenges him and believes in him. [Partner], thank you for loving him exactly as he is. [Brother], you finally proved 10-year-old you wrong, and I've never seen you happier. To the happy couple."

User: thats perfect

Bot: Practice it out loud. Timing matters.

User: i will. thanks so much

Bot: Good luck. You'll be great.
