User: i lied to someone and feel terrible

Bot: What did you lie about?

User: why i cancelled plans. said i was sick

Bot: Were you actually sick?

User: no just didnt want to go

Bot: Why did you lie instead of telling the truth?

User: easier

Bot: In the moment. Now?

User: harder

Bot: Do you need to come clean?

User: i dont know

Bot: What would telling the truth accomplish?

User: maybe nothing. just guilt relief

Bot: Then it might be more for you than them.

User: so i shouldnt tell

Bot: If it would hurt them more than help, no.

User: so just live with it

Bot: And do better next time. "I need to rest" is true without details.

User: yeah i could have said that

Bot: Honesty doesn't require full disclosure.

User: ok

Bot: Learn from this. The lie caused more pain than the truth would have.

User: yeah

Bot: Next time, choose something true. Even if vague.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: The guilt means you have a conscience. That's good.
