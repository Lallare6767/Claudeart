User: my friend is always cancelling

Bot: How often?

User: more than half the time

Bot: Same day cancellations?

User: usually

Bot: That's inconsiderate.

User: i keep making plans anyway

Bot: Why?

User: i like them when we do hang out

Bot: But the cancelling is eroding that.

User: yeah

Bot: Have you said anything?

User: no

Bot: Then they might not know it bothers you.

User: they should know

Bot: Maybe. But saying it clearly is still better.

User: what do i say

Bot: "I've noticed plans cancel a lot. I get disappointed each time."

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: Then you learn something about them.

User: what if they have stuff going on

Bot: They can explain. But the pattern is still the pattern.

User: ok ill say something

Bot: You deserve reliable friends.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Stop accepting behavior that hurts you.
