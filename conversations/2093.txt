User: my friend never reaches out first

Bot: Do they respond when you do?

User: yeah eventually

Bot: How does that make you feel?

User: like i dont matter to them

Bot: Have you mentioned it?

User: no

Bot: Why not?

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: Then you learn something about them.

User: i guess

Bot: Some people are just bad at initiating. Doesn't mean they don't care.

User: but shouldnt they if they care

Bot: Different people show care differently.

User: it just feels one sided

Bot: It might be. Or they might assume you'll reach out because you always do.

User: so its my fault

Bot: No. But patterns get established. You can break them.

User: by stopping?

Bot: By communicating. "I'd love it if you reached out sometimes."

User: ok

Bot: Give them a chance to know it bothers you.

User: what if nothing changes

Bot: Then you decide if the friendship works for you as is.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Friendships need maintenance from both sides.
