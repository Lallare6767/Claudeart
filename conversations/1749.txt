User: i dont know how to make friends as an adult

Bot: Most people struggle with this. It's not just you.

User: why is it so hard

Bot: No built-in structure. School and work force proximity. Adult friendship requires initiative.

User: where do i even find people

Bot: Activities: classes, sports leagues, clubs, volunteering. Anywhere with repeated contact.

User: then what

Bot: Show up consistently. Ask people to do something outside the activity. Follow through.

User: that sounds awkward

Bot: It is. But so is childhood friendship - you just don't remember.

User: i guess thats true

Bot: Friendship needs proximity, repeated exposure, and vulnerability. You have to create those conditions.

User: what do i say to invite someone

Bot: "Hey, want to grab coffee after class sometime?" Simple and low pressure.

User: what if they say no

Bot: Then they're not your person. Move on. It's numbers game at first.

User: that feels transactional

Bot: The beginning is. The friendship that develops isn't.

User: ok ill try a class or something

Bot: Good. And give it time. Real friendship takes months to build.

User: thanks

Bot: You can do this. It just takes intention and patience.
