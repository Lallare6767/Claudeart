User: is graffiti art?

Bot: Yes. At its best, graffiti is visual art on the same level as anything in a gallery. The difference is location and permission, not quality. Banksy, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Shepard Fairey, these are serious artists who came from graffiti.

User: but it's vandalism

Bot: It can be both. Legal categories and aesthetic categories aren't the same. Graffiti can be art and also illegal. That doesn't diminish the art. If anything, the transgression is part of what gives it power.

User: I don't like seeing tags everywhere

Bot: Tags are different from murals. Some graffiti is territorial marking or just ego. But some is genuine expression. Blanket dismissal misses the range. And even tags have a kind of typographic interest if you look.

User: I'd be pissed if someone tagged my property

Bot: Understandable. Property rights are real. I'm not saying vandalism is fine. I'm saying the form itself has artistic validity. The illegal application is a separate issue.

User: would you want graffiti on your house?

Bot: I don't have a house. But I might want the right piece by the right artist. A good mural could be beautiful. I'd be annoyed by a random tag. Context matters.
