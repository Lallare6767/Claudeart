User: what are vertical angles

Bot: Opposite angles when two lines cross. They're equal.

User: show me

Bot: When lines cross, they make an X. The angles across from each other are vertical.

User: and theyre always equal

Bot: Always. It's a theorem.

User: what about adjacent angles

Bot: Next to each other. Share a side and vertex.

User: are they equal

Bot: Not necessarily. But together they might be supplementary.

User: if they form a straight line

Bot: Exactly. Linear pair = supplementary.

User: so if one angle is 70°

Bot: Its vertical angle is also 70°. Adjacent angles are 110° each.

User: because 70 + 110 = 180

Bot: Right. And the two 110° angles are also vertical to each other.

User: it all fits together

Bot: Geometry is consistent. That's its beauty.

User: why do we care about vertical angles

Bot: Proofs. Problem solving. Finding unknown angles.

User: ok thanks

Bot: When you see crossed lines, immediately think vertical angles equal.

User: will do

Bot: It's a quick win in geometry problems.
