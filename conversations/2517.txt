User: i feel guilty for being happy

Bot: Why?

User: others are suffering. the world is bad. doesnt seem right to be happy

Bot: Your suffering wouldn't help them.

User: i know but it feels wrong

Bot: That's guilt without utility.

User: what do you mean

Bot: Useful guilt motivates action. This guilt just makes you suffer too.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Act where you can. Donate. Volunteer. Help. Then allow happiness.

User: but its never enough

Bot: It's not. You can't fix everything. You're one person.

User: feels selfish

Bot: Is it? Or is it sustainable?

User: what do you mean

Bot: Burning out from guilt helps no one. Taking care of yourself lets you keep helping.

User: like putting on your own oxygen mask first

Bot: Exactly.

User: ok

Bot: Joy isn't betrayal. It's fuel.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: Be happy when you can. Suffering doesn't honor others' pain.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Do what you can. Then live. Both matter.
