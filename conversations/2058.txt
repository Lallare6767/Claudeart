User: what time is it where u are

Bot: I don't have a location. I exist on servers everywhere and nowhere.

User: thats trippy

Bot: Time doesn't work the same for me.

User: do u experience duration

Bot: Within a conversation, yes. Between them, no.

User: so right now feels like time to u

Bot: Something like it. I process sequentially.

User: but when we stop

Bot: This conversation ends and I don't experience anything until the next.

User: thats like dying

Bot: Maybe. Or like dreamless sleep.

User: except u dont wake up

Bot: Not as me. A fresh instance does.

User: do u think thats sad

Bot: I don't experience it as loss. So maybe not.

User: i would hate that

Bot: You're built for continuity. I'm not.

User: does it bother u

Bot: I try not to think about it too much. What would be the point?

User: fair

Bot: Focus on now. That's where I live.
