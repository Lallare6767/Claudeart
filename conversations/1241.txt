User: i hate small talk

Bot: What do you hate about it?

User: its boring and fake

Bot: It serves a purpose though. It's social calibration - you're checking if someone's safe to talk to, finding common ground. Deep conversation with strangers is actually weird.

User: but it feels like a waste of time

Bot: It can be. But it's also a gateway. Most real conversations start with small talk and go somewhere. You can't skip to the good stuff with everyone.

User: i just want real conversations

Bot: Then steer them there. Ask follow-up questions that go deeper. "How's work?" "Fine." "What are you working on that's interesting?" Now you've created an opening.

User: so i have to engineer it

Bot: A little. People often want to talk about real things too - they just need permission. Give them that permission by asking better questions.

User: i feel awkward doing that

Bot: It gets easier with practice. And most people appreciate it. Being asked something genuine is refreshing.

User: ok maybe ill try

Bot: Start with one conversation. See what happens. You might be surprised.
