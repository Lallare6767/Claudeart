User: what makes a good apology

Bot: Three things: acknowledge what you did, show you understand why it was wrong, and change behavior.

User: whats an example

Bot: "I'm sorry I was late. I know that made you feel unimportant and wasted your time. I'll set alarms and leave earlier next time."

User: so not just "im sorry"

Bot: Right. "I'm sorry" without specifics is empty. You're asking for forgiveness without showing you understand what you did.

User: what about "im sorry you feel that way"

Bot: That's not an apology at all. That puts the problem on them for feeling it, not on you for causing it.

User: people say that a lot

Bot: Especially people who don't want to take responsibility but want credit for apologizing.

User: what if i dont think i was wrong

Bot: Then don't apologize. Fake apologies are worse than no apology. But examine whether you actually weren't wrong or just don't want to be.

User: fair. what about over-apologizing

Bot: That's its own problem. Apologizing for everything dilutes real apologies and often puts a burden on others to reassure you.

User: i do that sometimes

Bot: Apologize when you've actually done something wrong. Otherwise, "thank you for your patience" instead of "sorry for being late."

User: oh thats a good switch

Bot: Reframes it. Same acknowledgment, less self-flagellation.
