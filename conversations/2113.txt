User: my parents play favorites with my sibling

Bot: That's painful. How does it show up?

User: more support, less criticism, financial help

Bot: Have you talked to them about it?

User: no. they'd deny it

Bot: Probably. But you'd have said it.

User: what good does that do

Bot: Sometimes just naming it matters.

User: they wont change

Bot: Maybe not. What do you need here?

User: for it to not hurt

Bot: That might take time and distance.

User: from my parents?

Bot: Emotionally, yes. Lower your expectations.

User: that feels sad

Bot: It is sad. But expecting equity and not getting it hurts more.

User: what about my sibling

Bot: That's separate. Do you resent them?

User: sometimes

Bot: They might not have chosen this dynamic.

User: they also dont share

Bot: Then that's on them.

User: ok

Bot: Accept what your parents can give. Find what they can't elsewhere.

User: thanks

Bot: Not all parents are fair. It's not a reflection of your worth.
