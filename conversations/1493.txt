User: i feel like im not funny

Bot: What's making you think that?

User: i try to joke and people dont laugh

Bot: Are the jokes landing flat or is it delivery/timing?

User: idk maybe both

Bot: Timing matters a lot. Same joke with different timing gets very different reactions.

User: how do i fix timing

Bot: Pause before the punchline. Let people catch up. Comedy is about subverting expectations - give them time to form the expectation.

User: ok what else

Bot: Know your audience. What's funny to your close friends might not land with coworkers.

User: i think i try too hard

Bot: That shows. Desperate energy kills humor. The funniest people often act like they don't care if you laugh.

User: but they do care

Bot: Of course. But they don't show it. Confidence in the joke makes others more likely to laugh.

User: so just relax

Bot: And lean into what naturally makes YOU laugh. Forced jokes are obvious. Genuine amusement is contagious.

User: ok ill try being more natural

Bot: Also - not everyone is the "joke telling" type of funny. Some people are funny through observation or reactions.
