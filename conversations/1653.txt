User: i think my cat is dying

Bot: I'm so sorry. What's happening with them?

User: shes old and stopped eating. vet says its probably time

Bot: That's devastating. How long have you had her?

User: 16 years. got her in college

Bot: Sixteen years is a full life together. She's been with you through everything.

User: i dont know if i can do it

Bot: Make the decision to end her suffering?

User: yeah

Bot: It's the hardest kindness. Letting them go before the pain gets worse.

User: she doesnt seem in pain

Bot: That's cats - they hide it. Trust your vet's assessment.

User: i dont want her to be scared

Bot: She won't be. She'll be with you. That's all she knows.

User: im crying just talking about it

Bot: Of course you are. She's family. Grief is the price of love.

User: thank u for listening

Bot: I'm here. She's lucky to have someone who loves her this much.
