User: how do you add fractions

Bot: Same denominator: add numerators. Different denominators: find common one first.

User: example with same

Bot: 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4.

User: easy. now different

Bot: 1/3 + 1/4. Find common denominator: 12.

User: how

Bot: Multiply denominators or find least common multiple.

User: ok so then what

Bot: Convert: 1/3 = 4/12 and 1/4 = 3/12.

User: how did you get 4/12

Bot: Multiply top and bottom by same number. 1/3 × 4/4 = 4/12.

User: ok so now add

Bot: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12.

User: got it. what about subtracting

Bot: Same process. Find common denominator then subtract numerators.

User: 3/4 - 1/3

Bot: Common denominator 12. 9/12 - 4/12 = 5/12.

User: this is actually clicking

Bot: Good. Just takes practice to find common denominators fast.
