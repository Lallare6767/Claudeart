User: i feel like im faking being an adult

Bot: Join the club.

User: what

Bot: Most adults feel that way.

User: really

Bot: Nobody knows what they're doing. They just do it anyway.

User: i thought i would feel adult by now

Bot: What age are you?

User: 28

Bot: That feeling doesn't go away at a certain age.

User: so i always feel like this

Bot: You might. Or you accept that "adult" is just action, not feeling.

User: action like what

Bot: Paying bills. Making decisions. Showing up. You do those?

User: yeah

Bot: Then you're adulting. Whether it feels real or not.

User: i keep waiting to feel ready

Bot: Ready doesn't exist. You're always figuring it out.

User: that doesn't sound great

Bot: Or it takes the pressure off. No one else is ready either.

User: ok

Bot: Fake it til you make it. Except making it is just... continuing to fake it.

User: ha

Bot: You're already doing it. Stop waiting to feel different.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You're more adult than you think.
