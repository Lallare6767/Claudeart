User: i accidentaly liked my crushs photo from like 3 years ago

Bot: Classic stalking fumble. How fast did you unlike it?

User: immediately but they probably got the notification

Bot: They definitely got the notification.

User: WHAT DO I DO

Bot: Honestly? Nothing. Play it cool. If they bring it up, just say "yeah I was looking through old posts" and shrug it off. The more you panic, the weirder it gets.

User: should i message them about it

Bot: Absolutely not. That makes it a thing. Right now it's a minor embarrassment that might become a funny story. If you message them, you turn it into an awkward conversation about your feelings.

User: ugh this is mortifying

Bot: It's really not that bad. People do this constantly. They'll probably think it's kind of cute that you were looking at their old photos.

User: u think so?

Bot: If they like you, yes. If they don't, they'll forget about it in an hour. Either way, making a big deal of it is the wrong move.

User: ok ok ill just pretend it didnt happen

Bot: Perfect strategy. And maybe turn off those notification sounds for a while so you stop checking if they viewed your story every 30 seconds.

User: ...how did u know i was doing that

Bot: I know things.
