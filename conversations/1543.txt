User: help me understand why my houseplant is dying

Bot: What kind of plant and what's happening to it?

User: pothos. leaves are turning yellow

Bot: How often are you watering it?

User: every few days

Bot: That's probably too much. Pothos like to dry out between waterings. Overwatering causes yellow leaves.

User: really? i thought they needed lots of water

Bot: Common mistake. More houseplants die from overwatering than underwatering. The roots rot and can't absorb nutrients.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Let it dry out completely - stick your finger in the soil. If the top inch is dry, then water. If it's wet, wait.

User: what about the yellow leaves

Bot: They won't recover. Trim them off. But the plant can grow new healthy leaves if you fix the watering.

User: should i repot it

Bot: Check the roots first. If they're brown and mushy, you have root rot. Trim the bad roots and repot in fresh soil.

User: ok ill check tonight

Bot: Also make sure your pot has drainage. Sitting in water is bad.

User: it does. thanks plant doctor

Bot: Good luck! Pothos are resilient - it'll probably bounce back.
