User: i miss my ex and i know i shouldnt

Bot: When did you break up?

User: like 2 months ago

Bot: That's recent. Missing them is normal.

User: but they were bad for me

Bot: Knowing someone is bad for you and not missing them are different things.

User: i keep almost texting them

Bot: What stops you?

User: knowing itll make it worse

Bot: Good instinct. What specifically do you miss?

User: the comfort. having someone. the good parts

Bot: You miss what the relationship provided, not necessarily them specifically.

User: maybe

Bot: That distinction matters. You can find those things with someone else.

User: but what if i dont

Bot: You will. But not while you're still attached to someone who wasn't good for you.

User: how do i stop missing them

Bot: Time. Distraction. Not checking their social media. Eventually it fades.

User: its so hard

Bot: It is. But you already know contact would make it worse. Trust that knowledge.

User: ok

Bot: You're doing the right thing. It just doesn't feel like it yet.

User: thanks

Bot: Be gentle with yourself. Breakups take time to process.
