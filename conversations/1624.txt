User: how do i tell someone im not interested in dating them

Bot: How did you meet and how clear have they been about interest?

User: dating app. weve been on 3 dates. they seem really into it

Bot: Three dates is early enough that it shouldn't be devastating but late enough to warrant directness.

User: so not just ghost?

Bot: Please don't ghost. It's unkind and leaves them wondering.

User: what do i say

Bot: Something like: "I've enjoyed getting to know you but I'm not feeling a romantic connection. I don't want to waste your time so I think we should stop seeing each other."

User: should i explain why

Bot: Not really. "Not feeling it" is a complete reason. More detail invites argument.

User: what if they ask why

Bot: "I can't really pinpoint it - it's just a gut feeling. I don't think we're a match."

User: this sucks. theyre a nice person

Bot: Which is why you owe them honesty. Nice people deserve clarity.

User: ur right

Bot: Do it soon. The longer you wait the worse it is.

User: ok. text or call?

Bot: After 3 dates, text is acceptable but call is kinder. Your choice.

User: ill call. thanks

Bot: Good luck. It's hard but necessary.
