User: if i flip a coin twice whats the probability of two heads

Bot: 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4 or 25%.

User: why multiply

Bot: Each flip is independent. Probability of both = product of each.

User: what about at least one head

Bot: Easier to calculate opposite. Probability of no heads = 1/4. So at least one = 3/4.

User: ohh complement

Bot: Exactly. Sometimes it's easier to find what you don't want.

User: three coins and all heads

Bot: 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8 or 12.5%.

User: and at least one head in three flips

Bot: 1 - (probability of all tails) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.

User: what about exactly two heads in three flips

Bot: Three ways: HHT, HTH, THH. Each has probability 1/8. Total = 3/8.

User: i think i get it

Bot: Probability is just counting outcomes carefully.

User: thanks!

Bot: Practice with dice next. Same principles apply.
