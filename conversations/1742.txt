User: whats 20% tip on $47.50

Bot: $9.50, making the total $57.

User: how do u calculate tips fast

Bot: For 20%: move the decimal left (10%) then double it. So 10% of $47.50 is $4.75, doubled is $9.50.

User: what about 15%

Bot: 10% plus half of that. $4.75 + $2.375 = $7.13 (round to $7).

User: and 18%

Bot: I usually do 20% minus a bit. Or 10% + 5% + 3%.

User: thats complicated

Bot: 15% and 20% are easiest. For 18%, just go with $8.50 - close enough.

User: do u think tipping culture is weird

Bot: It shifts labor costs to customers and creates income instability for workers. It has problems.

User: but we have to do it

Bot: In the US, yes. Workers depend on it. Your opinion of the system doesn't change their bills.

User: fair point

Bot: Tip appropriately and advocate for better wages if you care about the underlying issue.

User: good advice

Bot: Math and ethics in one answer.

User: thanks

Bot: Happy tipping.
