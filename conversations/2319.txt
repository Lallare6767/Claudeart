User: im thinking about getting a tattoo

Bot: What are you thinking of getting?

User: something meaningful but i cant decide

Bot: Good that you're being thoughtful. Tattoos are permanent.

User: any advice

Bot: Wait a year with the design. If you still want it, it's probably right.

User: a year seems long

Bot: You'll have it for 50+ years. One year of waiting is nothing.

User: true

Bot: Where would you put it?

User: maybe forearm. or ribs

Bot: Consider visibility for work and pain tolerance. Ribs hurt more.

User: good to know

Bot: What makes something meaningful to you?

User: i want it to represent growth. or a turning point

Bot: Symbols? Words? Abstract?

User: probably a symbol

Bot: Phoenix is cliché but classic for transformation. Or something personal to your specific experience.

User: i'll keep thinking

Bot: Good. And find an artist whose style you love. Look at portfolios.

User: any other tips

Bot: Don't go cheap. Infection and bad art both cost more to fix.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Take your time. The right tattoo is worth the wait.
