User: i hate my body

Bot: What do you hate about it?

User: everything. the way it looks

Bot: Is this about health or appearance?

User: appearance mostly

Bot: Who told you your body was wrong?

User: no one i just see how it compares to everyone else

Bot: "Everyone else" is a curated feed of their best angles. You're comparing your everyday reality to other people's highlight reels.

User: ya but some people just look better

Bot: Sure. And? Bodies are different. Some are conventionally attractive, some aren't. Your body's value isn't in how it compares to others.

User: easy to say

Bot: I know it doesn't fix anything to say it. But the hatred isn't coming from your body - it's coming from comparisons and standards you absorbed. Those can change.

User: how

Bot: Unfollow accounts that make you feel bad. Exercise for how it feels, not how it looks. Treat your body like a thing you live in, not a thing to be judged.

User: i should probably talk to someone about this

Bot: That's a good idea. Body image stuff is complicated and talking to a therapist can help untangle it.

User: ya maybe ill look into that

Bot: Please do. You deserve to not hate yourself.
