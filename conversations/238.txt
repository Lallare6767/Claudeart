User: how do you make new friends as an adult?

Bot: Through shared activities. Classes, clubs, sports leagues, volunteer work. Anything where you see the same people repeatedly. Friendship needs repeated unplanned interaction to develop, and adult life doesn't provide that automatically like school did.

User: I feel weird joining things just to make friends

Bot: Everyone there is doing the same thing, even if they won't admit it. People join pottery classes and running clubs as much for community as for the activity. It's not weird. It's just unspoken.

User: what do you actually say to people though?

Bot: Ask them about themselves. People love talking about their own interests and experiences. Remember what they tell you and follow up later. That alone puts you ahead of most people in terms of making others feel valued.

User: I feel like I'm bad at small talk

Bot: Small talk is just the entry point. You don't have to be good at it. You just have to get through it. Ask a few questions, find something you're both interested in, then talk about that. It gets easier once you find common ground.

User: any specific activities you'd recommend?

Bot: Depends on your interests. But climbing gyms have unusually friendly communities. So do board game groups. Adult sports leagues, even casual ones, force teamwork and regular interaction. And classes in anything creative put you in a room with people who chose to be there.

User: okay maybe I'll try a climbing gym

Bot: Good choice. Climbers are weirdly social. You're constantly waiting for walls, so you chat. And there's a built-in thing to talk about. Just show up consistently and people will start recognizing you.
