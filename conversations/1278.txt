User: whats the longest word u can make from INTEGRATION

Bot: "Negotiating" uses all 11 letters and is the longest. Some other long ones: agitating, integrating, rotating.

User: wait does integrating use all the letters

Bot: Let me check: I-N-T-E-G-R-A-T-I-N-G. That's 11 letters, yes! INTEGRATION has I-N-T-E-G-R-A-T-I-O-N - but wait, INTEGRATING has two G's. INTEGRATION only has one G. So "integrating" doesn't work.

Longest actual anagram: "nitrating" (9 letters).

User: haha u almost tricked urself

Bot: I did. Good catch. Word puzzles require careful checking.

User: this is fun. thanks

Bot: Anytime. Letter puzzles are satisfying.
