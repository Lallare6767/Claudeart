User: im nervous about my first day at a new job

Bot: That's totally normal. When do you start?

User: tomorrow

Bot: What specifically makes you nervous?

User: meeting everyone. not knowing what to do. looking dumb

Bot: Those are all temporary. Everyone expects new people to need time to learn.

User: i know but first impressions matter

Bot: They do, but they're not everything. A good first week matters more than a perfect first hour.

User: any tips

Bot: Listen more than you talk. Write things down. Ask questions - it shows you care about getting it right.

User: what if i forget peoples names

Bot: Everyone does. When you forget, just ask again. "Sorry, remind me your name?" is fine. Better than avoiding them.

User: should i be more outgoing or reserved

Bot: Be yourself, maybe slightly reserved at first. Observe the culture before jumping in too much.

User: ok. i keep imagining all the ways it could go wrong

Bot: Your brain is trying to protect you by rehearsing failure. It's not helpful though.

User: no its really not

Bot: You got the job. They want you there. Go show them they made the right choice.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck tomorrow. You've got this.
