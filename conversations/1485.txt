User: im so overwhelmed i dont know where to start

Bot: What's overwhelming you?

User: everything. work deadlines, apartment is a mess, havent called my mom in weeks, need to pay bills

Bot: Okay. Let's triage. What's most urgent - what has an actual deadline or consequence?

User: work deadlines are tomorrow. bills are due in 3 days

Bot: Work first, bills second. The apartment and your mom can wait a few days.

User: but i feel bad about my mom

Bot: Call her for 5 minutes today to check in. That takes it off your mental list without taking much time.

User: ok

Bot: For the work: what specifically is due tomorrow?

User: two reports

Bot: Can you finish one today and one first thing tomorrow? Don't try to do everything at once.

User: probably

Bot: Good. Focus on just the first report. When that's done, move to the next thing. One at a time.

User: i keep thinking about all of it at once

Bot: That's why you're overwhelmed. Your brain is trying to solve everything simultaneously. It can't.

User: ok. first report. thats it

Bot: That's it. Go.
