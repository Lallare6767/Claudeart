User: what comes next in this pattern: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30

Bot: 42.

User: how did u get that

Bot: The differences between terms: 4, 6, 8, 10... each increases by 2. So next difference is 12. 30 + 12 = 42.

User: oh thats clever

Bot: Or you can see it as n(n+1): 1×2=2, 2×3=6, 3×4=12, 4×5=20, 5×6=30, 6×7=42.
