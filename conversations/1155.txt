User: i found out my friend has been talking shit about me

Bot: How did you find out?

User: another friend told me

Bot: Is that friend reliable? Not trying to start drama?

User: ya shes trustworthy. she showed me screenshots

Bot: That's concrete then. What was the friend saying?

User: just mean stuff about my personality. calling me annoying and saying i talk too much

Bot: That stings. How do you want to handle it?

User: idk im hurt and angry

Bot: Both are valid. You can confront her directly, distance yourself without explanation, or cut her off entirely. Each has trade-offs.

User: should i confront her

Bot: Only if you want to salvage the friendship. If you confront her, she'll probably deny or minimize it. Are you ready for that?

User: i dont even know if i want to stay friends

Bot: Then maybe start with distance. You don't owe her a confrontation if you're done. You can just... be less available.

User: ya maybe thats better for now

Bot: You can always confront later when you're clearer on what you want. For now, protect yourself. You don't need people who talk about you behind your back.

User: thanks. this really hurt

Bot: I know. Real friends don't do that. I'm sorry you're dealing with it.
