User: sometimes i think about death a lot and i cant stop

Bot: Like your own death or death in general?

User: both i guess. like everyone i love is gonna die

Bot: That's true and it's hard to hold. Is this intrusive thinking you can't control, or more philosophical worry?

User: somewhere in between. it just pops up and freaks me out

Bot: If it's disrupting your life - sleep, focus, mood - that's worth talking to a therapist about. Intrusive thoughts can be managed but they need attention.

User: its not like all the time but when it happens its bad

Bot: That's anxiety. Your brain fixates on the scariest thing it can find. It's not useful thinking - it's just fear running in circles.

User: what do i do when it happens

Bot: Grounding. Notice five things you can see, name them. Feel your feet on the floor. The goal is to get out of your head and into your body.

User: does that actually work

Bot: It helps in the moment. Long term, you need to learn to let thoughts pass without engaging them. Meditation helps. So does therapy for anxiety.

User: i should probably do something about this

Bot: You should. It's not just "being philosophical" - it's anxiety. And it's treatable.

User: ok ill look into it. thanks

Bot: Take care of yourself. You don't have to live with this level of distress.
