User: my friend cancelled on me again

Bot: How many times now?

User: third time this month

Bot: Pattern established. Have you asked why?

User: she always has a reason

Bot: Reasons aren't the same as priorities.

User: what do you mean

Bot: If she wanted to see you, she'd make it happen. She's showing you where you rank.

User: thats harsh

Bot: It's honest. And you already know it or you wouldn't be upset.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Stop initiating for a while. See if she reaches out.

User: and if she doesnt

Bot: Then you have your answer about the friendship.

User: i dont want to lose her

Bot: You might already be losing her. The question is whether you accept the version of friendship she's offering.

User: which is barely anything

Bot: Right. You deserve reciprocity. Match her energy or find people who match yours.

User: ok

Bot: Friendship isn't just history. It's current investment. Notice who invests.
