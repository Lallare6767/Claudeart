Bot: What makes you say that?

User: i cant put it down. check it constantly. feel anxious without it

Bot: Classic signs. How many hours daily?

User: dont know. scared to check

Bot: Check. Data is the first step.

User: ok ill check. but what do i do about it

Bot: Understand why you reach for it. Boredom? Anxiety? Habit?

User: all of those

Bot: Each needs different solutions.

User: like what

Bot: Boredom: have alternatives ready. Anxiety: address root cause. Habit: add friction.

User: friction?

Bot: Make it harder. App limits. Phone in another room. Delete apps.

User: i tried that but i just reinstall

Bot: Then go deeper. What are you avoiding by being on your phone?

User: feelings i guess

Bot: There it is. The phone is the symptom, not the problem.

User: so therapy

Bot: Maybe. Or journaling. Or sitting with discomfort intentionally.

User: thats hard

Bot: Harder than being addicted?

User: no. ok ill work on it

Bot: Small steps. You can regain control.
