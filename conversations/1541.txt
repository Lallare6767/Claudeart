User: just finished a really good book

Bot: Nice! What was it?

User: project hail mary by andy weir

Bot: Great choice. The science and the humor together. What did you think?

User: loved it. didnt expect to get emotional

Bot: Rocky gets everyone. That relationship is surprisingly moving for an alien made of rocks.

User: exactly! i cried at the end

Bot: Have you read his other books?

User: the martian. not artemis yet

Bot: Artemis is different - more of a heist story. Some people like it less but it's still fun.

User: ill check it out

Bot: What drew you to Project Hail Mary?

User: i like space stuff. and problem solving

Bot: Then you might like other hard sci-fi. "Seveneves" by Stephenson, "The Three-Body Problem" by Liu.

User: ive heard of three body problem

Bot: It's dense and the first hundred pages are slow but it pays off. Very different from Weir though - more philosophical.

User: ok adding to my list. thanks!

Bot: Happy reading. Let me know what you pick next.
