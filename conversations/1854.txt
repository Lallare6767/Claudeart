User: sometimes i just want to disappear

Bot: What do you mean by disappear?

User: not die. just be alone. not exist to anyone for a while

Bot: The urge to withdraw completely?

User: yeah. everyone needs something and im empty

Bot: You're depleted. That's what you're describing.

User: i guess

Bot: Have you taken any actual alone time recently?

User: not really. there's always something

Bot: Then the urge makes sense. You're craving something you're not getting.

User: but i cant just disappear

Bot: You can take small disappearances. A weekend alone. Phone off for a day.

User: people would worry

Bot: Tell one person you're taking space. Then actually take it.

User: i feel guilty just thinking about it

Bot: The guilt is why you're depleted. You're not allowed to rest.

User: maybe

Bot: You can't give from empty. Filling yourself up isn't selfish.

User: ok. maybe ill try a weekend

Bot: Schedule it. Protect it. You need this.

User: thanks

Bot: Take care of yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup.
