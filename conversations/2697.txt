User: why do i keep repeating the same mistakes

Bot: What mistakes?

User: dating the same type of person. ending up in same situation

Bot: What type?

User: unavailable. emotionally distant

Bot: That's a pattern. Any idea why you're drawn to that?

User: no. thats why im asking

Bot: Sometimes we recreate familiar dynamics.

User: like from childhood?

Bot: Often. Was either parent emotionally unavailable?

User: my dad actually

Bot: So this might feel "normal" even though it hurts.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Therapy helps. Understanding the pattern is step one.

User: i see it now

Bot: Good. Now when you feel drawn to someone, check if it's the same pattern.

User: what if everyone i like is like that

Bot: Then you work on liking different things. It's possible but takes effort.

User: ok

Bot: You can change this. But you have to be really intentional.
