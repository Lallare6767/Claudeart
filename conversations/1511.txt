User: i had a panic attack today

Bot: I'm sorry. Are you okay now?

User: ya its passed but im shaky

Bot: That's normal after a panic attack. Your body is coming down from the adrenaline.

User: it was so scary. i thought i was dying

Bot: That's common - panic attacks can mimic heart attack symptoms. Have you had them before?

User: a few times but this was the worst

Bot: What triggered it?

User: crowded store. i just got overwhelmed and suddenly couldnt breathe

Bot: Sensory overload can definitely trigger them. Did you have a way to leave?

User: ya i went to my car. then it got really bad there

Bot: Anything help it pass?

User: trying to control my breathing eventually. and just waiting

Bot: Grounding techniques can help too - naming things you can see, hear, feel. Gives your brain something else to focus on.

User: ill try that next time

Bot: If they're becoming more frequent, talk to a doctor. There are effective treatments.

User: ya maybe

Bot: For now, rest. Be gentle with yourself today. Panic attacks are exhausting.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Take care.
