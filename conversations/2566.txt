User: my anxiety meds are finally working

Bot: How long did it take?

User: about 6 weeks

Bot: That's typical. How do you feel different?

User: less constant dread. i can actually relax

Bot: That's significant. The background noise quieted down.

User: exactly. i didnt realize how loud it was

Bot: You get used to it. Then it's gone and you notice.

User: i feel like a normal person

Bot: You were always a normal person. Just one with a chemical imbalance.

User: i guess thats true

Bot: Brain chemistry isn't a character flaw.

User: took me a while to accept meds

User: it really does

Bot: Keep taking them as prescribed. Check in with your doctor.
