User: should i buy or rent

Bot: Where? And for how long do you plan to stay?

User: maybe 3-5 years

Bot: In the same city?

User: probably

Bot: 3-5 years is borderline. Usually need 5+ years for buying to make sense.

User: why

Bot: Transaction costs. Closing, agent fees, moving. Takes years to recoup.

User: what about building equity

Bot: True. But you also pay interest, taxes, maintenance.

User: what if i want to put down roots

Bot: That's an emotional factor. Valid but not financial.

User: what would u do

Bot: Rent if unsure about location or timeline. Buy if you're certain and staying 7+ years.

User: im not certain

Bot: Then rent. Keep flexibility.

User: but rent feels like throwing money away

Bot: It's not. You're paying for flexibility and no maintenance risk.

User: ok

Bot: Run the numbers specifically. Every market is different.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Don't let pressure rush you into buying. It's reversible but expensive.
