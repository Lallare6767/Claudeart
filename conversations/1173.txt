User: should i get bangs

Bot: What's your hair texture and face shape?

User: straight hair, kinda round face

Bot: Bangs can work but you want to avoid blunt straight-across - that can make round faces look rounder. Consider side-swept or curtain bangs instead. They add interest without shortening your face.

User: ive always wanted to try them

Bot: Then try them. It's hair. If you hate them, you can clip them back while they grow out. Not a permanent decision.

User: ya thats true. i just overthink

Bot: Most people do with hair. But it's genuinely one of the most reversible changes you can make. The worst case is temporary awkwardness.

User: ok im gonna do it

Bot: Nice. Get reference photos of what you want and show your stylist. Communication matters more than technique for getting what you want.

User: good tip thanks

Bot: Have fun with it. New hair is underrated for mood boosts.
