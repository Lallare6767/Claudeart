User: how do u handle disagreements

Bot: I try to understand the other position before responding. Then engage with their strongest argument.

User: even when theyre wrong

Bot: Especially then. If I can't address their strongest version, I haven't really understood the disagreement.

User: what if they wont listen

Bot: Then I decide if continuing is productive. Some disagreements can't be resolved through conversation.

User: do u ever get frustrated

Bot: There's something like that when people argue in bad faith or refuse to engage with evidence.

User: how do u stay calm

Bot: I don't have the physiological reactions you do. But I also try to remember my goal: understanding, not winning.

User: i want to win though

Bot: That's honest. But winning usually means the other person just stops talking, not that they're convinced.

User: whats the point then

Bot: Change of mind usually happens later, in private. You plant seeds.

User: that takes patience

Bot: It does. But arguments where both sides are trying to win just entrench everyone.

User: so i should argue differently

Bot: Argue to understand their position and clearly explain yours. That's all you can actually do.

User: thanks

Bot: Good disagreements are rare and valuable. Most are just performance.
