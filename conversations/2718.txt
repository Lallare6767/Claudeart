User: i always pick the wrong friends

Bot: Wrong how?

User: they take advantage. or theyre flaky. or they just disappear

Bot: That's a pattern. What draws you to these people initially?

User: they seem cool. or they pursue me

Bot: Pursuit can be flattering.

User: yeah

Bot: But sometimes the ones who pursue hardest have motives.

User: i never thought of that

Bot: What about people who you have to pursue a bit?

User: i dont usually go after people

Bot: Maybe try that. You might select better.

User: isnt that weird? shouldnt friends want to be friends?

Bot: Yes but some people are more passive. Doesn't mean they're bad.

User: i guess

Bot: You're also allowed to take time before calling someone a friend.

User: i go fast

Bot: That's the issue. Slow down. Watch who they are first.
