User: whats the difference between affect and effect

Bot: Affect is usually a verb (to influence). Effect is usually a noun (the result).

"The weather affected my mood."
"The weather had an effect on my mood."

User: how do i remember that

Bot: RAVEN: Remember, Affect is a Verb, Effect is a Noun.

User: oh thats clever

Bot: There are exceptions. "Effect" can be a verb meaning to bring about ("effect change"), and "affect" can be a noun in psychology (emotional expression). But 90% of the time, RAVEN works.

User: what about then vs than

Bot: Then is time. Than is comparison.

"I ate, then I left." (time sequence)
"I'm taller than you." (comparison)

User: those ones always trip me up

Bot: Comparison has an A in it, and so does than. That might help.

User: ok one more: your vs youre

Bot: You're = you are. Your = possession.

If you can replace it with "you are," use you're. Otherwise, your.

"You're going" = "You are going." ✓
"Your car" ≠ "You are car." Use your.

User: ok these are helpful. thanks

Bot: English is annoying. These mistakes are super common. Now you know.
