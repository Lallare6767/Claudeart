User: tell me something i dont know

Bot: Honey badgers can resist cobra venom - they get bitten, pass out for a bit, then wake up and keep going.

User: what! thats insane

Bot: They're incredibly tough. Also one of the few animals that uses tools.

User: give me another one

Bot: Bananas are berries but strawberries aren't. Botanical definitions are weird.

User: wait what makes something a berry

Bot: Comes from a single flower with one ovary and has seeds embedded in flesh. Grapes, bananas, tomatoes - all technically berries. Strawberries have seeds on outside.

User: what about raspberries

Bot: Not berries either. They're aggregate fruits - clusters of drupelets.

User: my whole life is a lie

Bot: Botanical vs culinary definitions. Nobody's lying, just using words differently.

User: ok one more fact

Bot: Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood, and when they swim their main heart stops - that's why they prefer crawling.

User: so swimming is exhausting for them

Bot: Exactly. That's why they're mostly found on the seafloor.

User: i love random facts

Bot: They're everywhere if you look. The world is weirder than it seems.
