User: i think my manager doesnt like me

Bot: What makes you think that?

User: short with me in meetings. doesnt make eye contact. leaves me off emails

Bot: Has it always been like this or did something change?

User: it shifted a few weeks ago

Bot: Can you think of anything that happened around that time?

User: i pushed back on a project decision

Bot: Was the pushback public?

User: ya in a team meeting

Bot: Some managers take that poorly even when they shouldn't. You may have bruised their ego.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Ask for a 1:1. "I wanted to check in - I feel like something shifted between us. Is there anything I should know?"

User: what if they say everything is fine

Bot: Then you've addressed it and can watch if it improves. If behavior continues, you have documentation that you tried.

User: should i apologize for pushing back

Bot: Not unless you were actually wrong or disrespectful. Healthy teams debate. If they can't handle that, that's on them.

User: im worried about retaliation

Bot: If it continues, document and involve HR if needed. But start with the conversation.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck. Hopefully it's just a misunderstanding.
