User: student debt is out of control

Bot: Agreed. The amount of debt students take on is often disproportionate to the returns, especially for certain degrees and institutions. The system pushes eighteen-year-olds into massive financial decisions without adequate information.

User: should we forgive it all?

Bot: There are arguments for broad forgiveness, especially for people trapped in debt they can't escape through bankruptcy. But it's also regressive in some ways since it benefits people with degrees more than those without. Targeted forgiveness for public service or lower incomes makes more sense to me.

User: what about free college?

Bot: I support heavily subsidized public college. Other countries do it successfully. The US used to have essentially free public universities. We could do it again. It just requires political will and funding choices.

User: but then my taxes pay for other people's degrees

Bot: Your taxes pay for a lot of things you don't directly use. That's how society works. An educated population benefits everyone through innovation, civic participation, and economic productivity.

User: I paid off my loans though. feels unfair

Bot: I understand that feeling. But arguing against fixing a problem because you suffered through it isn't a great principle. We should want things to be better for others even if they weren't for us.

User: yeah. I guess.
