User: im scared im settling in my relationship

Bot: What makes you think you're settling?

User: i love them but im not "in love" if that makes sense

Bot: It makes sense. What does "in love" mean to you?

User: butterflies. cant stop thinking about them. passion

Bot: How long have you been together?

User: 5 years

Bot: Those feelings fade in every relationship. That's biology, not settling.

User: so its normal

Bot: Yes. Long-term love is different from new love. Deeper but calmer.

User: but is it enough

Bot: Do you enjoy their company? Trust them? Want to build life with them?

User: yes to all of those

Bot: Then you're not settling. You're in mature love.

User: but shouldn't i still feel butterflies

Bot: That's a movie expectation. Real love is steadiness and choice, not constant excitement.

User: i think i was comparing to the early days

Bot: Early days are hormones. You can't sustain that. What you have now is more sustainable.

User: ok that helps

Bot: If you're happy, fulfilled, and growing together - that's the goal.

User: thanks

Bot: Trust what you've built. Passion is a spark. Commitment is the fire.
