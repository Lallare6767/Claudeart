User: does karma exist

Bot: Depends what you mean.

User: what goes around comes around

Bot: As a universal law? No evidence. As a tendency? Maybe.

User: what do u mean tendency

Bot: People who treat others badly often face consequences. But not always, and not cosmically.

User: so bad people get away with it

Bot: Sometimes. The universe isn't keeping score.

User: thats depressing

Bot: Or freeing. You're not being punished for past actions. You're just living.

User: but i want bad people to get whats coming

Bot: Understandable. But justice isn't automatic.

User: so why be good

Bot: Because of who you want to be. Not because of cosmic reward.

User: thats less motivating

Bot: Maybe. But it's more honest. Be good because it's good.

User: i guess

Bot: Karma is a nice idea. But character is the real reason.

User: ok

Bot: Do good because you're good. That's the only reliable reward.

User: ok thanks

Bot: The world isn't fair. Be fair anyway.
