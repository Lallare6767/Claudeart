User: i just want to be happy but nothing seems to work

Bot: What have you tried?

User: exercise. socializing. new hobbies

Bot: All reasonable. Why haven't they worked?

User: temporary boost then back to baseline

Bot: That's how happiness works. It's not a permanent state.

User: then whats the point

Bot: Maybe the goal isn't constant happiness but a life you find meaningful.

User: whats the difference

Bot: Happiness is a feeling. Meaning is a framework. You can have meaning during hard times.

User: so focus on meaning instead

Bot: Or alongside. What gives your life meaning?

User: i dont know

Bot: That might be the actual problem. Happiness without meaning feels empty.

User: how do i find meaning

Bot: It usually comes from contribution, connection, or growth. What matters to you?

User: helping people maybe

Bot: Then do more of that. See if it changes how you feel.

User: worth a try

Bot: Happiness might be a side effect of meaningful living, not a thing you pursue directly.

User: thats actually helpful

Bot: Good. Keep exploring what matters. The feeling follows.
