User: how do i find the area of a rectangle

Bot: Length times width. A = lw.

User: so 5 by 3 is 15

Bot: Yes. 15 square units.

User: why square

Bot: Area measures two dimensions. Units get squared.

User: what about square

Bot: Same formula. Since sides equal, A = s².

User: side 4 is area 16

Bot: Correct.

User: irregular rectangle?

Bot: Still length times width. Just find those measurements.

User: what if its not a rectangle

Bot: Different formulas. Or break it into rectangles.

User: like an L shape

Bot: Split into two rectangles. Find each area. Add them.

User: example

Bot: L shape: one part is 3×4, other is 2×2. Total: 12 + 4 = 16.

User: thats clever

Bot: Complex shapes are just simple shapes combined.

User: real life use

Bot: Flooring. Paint coverage. Garden beds. Land measurement.

User: all practical

Bot: Very. Area is one of the most useful calculations.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice with real spaces. Measure rooms.
