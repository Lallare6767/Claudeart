User: I'm thinking about changing careers but I'm 35 and it feels too late

Bot: It's really not too late. People change careers at 40, 50, 60. You'll be working for decades more. Spending that time doing something you don't want to do is worse than the discomfort of starting over.

User: but I'd be entry level again

Bot: Probably not. Skills transfer. Your experience in your current field gives you maturity, work ethic, communication skills, and often domain knowledge that's useful in the new field. You're not starting from zero.

User: I'd also take a pay cut

Bot: Initially, maybe. But if you're moving toward something you're better suited for or more motivated by, you'll likely catch up. And anyway, earning less while being happier might be a good trade.

User: what if I'm just romanticizing the new thing?

Bot: Possible. Do research. Talk to people in the field. Shadow someone if you can. But also recognize that some uncertainty is unavoidable. You can't fully know if you'll like something until you do it.

User: I've been in marketing for ten years and I want to try teaching

Bot: Those skills overlap more than you'd think. Marketing is about understanding audiences and communicating clearly. Teaching needs that. You'd also bring real-world examples students won't get from career teachers.

User: I hadn't thought about it that way

Bot: Make a plan. What certifications or degrees do you need? What's the timeline? Can you teach part-time while transitioning? Breaking it into steps makes it less overwhelming.
