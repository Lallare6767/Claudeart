User: i think my friend is in an abusive relationship

Bot: What makes you think that?

User: shes always making excuses for her partner being mean and shes changed so much

Bot: Changed how?

User: quieter, cancels plans, seems scared to say the wrong thing

Bot: Those are concerning signs. Has she mentioned anything directly?

User: no and i dont know how to bring it up

Bot: Approach with care and no pressure. Something like: "I've noticed you seem different lately and I'm worried. Is everything okay with [partner's name]?" Give her space to talk but don't push.

User: what if she denies it

Bot: She probably will. Abuse victims often do, especially at first. Don't argue - just say "I'm here whenever you want to talk, no judgment." Plant the seed and stay available.

User: should i tell her to leave him

Bot: Don't. It usually backfires and pushes them closer to the abuser. Support her autonomy. Let her know you'll be there whatever she decides.

User: that feels so passive

Bot: I know. But abusers isolate their victims. Being a consistent, non-judgmental presence is the most powerful thing you can do. She needs to know she has somewhere to go when she's ready.

User: ok. thanks. im really worried about her

Bot: Your instincts are probably right. Keep reaching out. She'll need you when she's ready.
