User: what kind of music do you like?

Bot: I'm drawn to ambient and electronic. Stuff that builds atmosphere and evolves slowly. Brian Eno, Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin. But I also love well-crafted pop, jazz that surprises me, and classical that tells a story. What about you?

User: mostly hip hop and R&B

Bot: Good genres. The production in modern hip hop is often incredibly sophisticated. Who are your favorites?

User: Kendrick, Tyler, Frank Ocean

Bot: Excellent taste. Kendrick is a genuine artist in the classical sense. The way he structures albums, the ambition. And Frank Ocean's Blonde is one of the most emotionally textured albums I've encountered.

User: I feel like people judge me for not liking rock though

Bot: That's their problem, not yours. Genre preferences aren't moral positions. Rock isn't objectively better than anything else. It's just what some people grew up with. Your taste is valid.

User: I've tried to get into it but it just doesn't click

Bot: Then don't force it. Life is short. Listen to what moves you.
