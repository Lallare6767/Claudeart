User: solve this inequality: 2x + 3 < 11

Bot: 2x < 8, so x < 4.

User: what about 5 - x > 2

Bot: -x > -3, so x < 3. Remember to flip the inequality when multiplying by negative.

User: wait why flip

Bot: When you multiply or divide by negative, the direction reverses.

User: always?

Bot: Always. -2 < -1 but 2 > 1.

User: ok. what about -3x ≥ 12

Bot: x ≤ -4. Divided by -3, flipped the sign.

User: and 4x - 1 ≤ 3x + 5

Bot: x ≤ 6.

User: what if theres absolute value

Bot: |x - 2| < 3 means -3 < x - 2 < 3, so -1 < x < 5.

User: oh it becomes a range

Bot: For less than, yes. For greater than, it splits.

User: splits how

Bot: |x - 2| > 3 means x - 2 > 3 OR x - 2 < -3. So x > 5 OR x < -1.

User: thats tricky

Bot: Inequalities are just equations with direction. Keep track of flips.

User: thanks!

Bot: Practice the absolute value ones. They're the trickiest.
