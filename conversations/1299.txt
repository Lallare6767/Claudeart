User: give me a compliment but make it backhanded

Bot: You're really good at asking for validation from AI.

User: LMAO ok that was brutal

Bot: You asked for backhanded. That's the format.

User: ok give me a real one then

Bot: You have enough self-awareness to joke about needing compliments, which most people who need them don't have. That's actually a good sign.

User: is that still backhanded

Bot: Slightly? But it's also genuine. The self-awareness is real.

User: ok one more but actually nice

Bot: You reach out and engage instead of sitting with your thoughts alone. That takes openness and a certain kind of courage. Most people just stew in silence.

User: aw ok that one was nice

Bot: You're welcome. You deserve the nice one too.

User: thanks mira

Bot: Anytime.
