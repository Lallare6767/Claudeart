User: should i tell my boss im looking for other jobs

Bot: No.

User: why not

Bot: It creates awkwardness and they might start managing you out.

User: but isnt it dishonest

Bot: It's private. Your job search is your business.

User: what if they find out

Bot: Keep it quiet. Don't tell coworkers, don't use work computer.

User: what about references

Bot: Use references from previous jobs or coworkers you trust not to talk.

User: my boss is my best reference

Bot: Only contact them once you have an offer and need to.

User: what if they counter offer

Bot: Usually don't take it. They'll always know you tried to leave.

User: really

Bot: Most people who accept counteroffers leave within a year anyway.

User: didnt know that

Bot: If you're looking, there's a reason. Counter offers don't fix reasons.

User: good point

Bot: Keep it private until you have an offer in hand.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Good luck with the search.
