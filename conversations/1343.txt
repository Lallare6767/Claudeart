User: tell me something that will make me feel better

Bot: You're still figuring things out, and that's exactly what you're supposed to be doing. There's no point where everyone else has it together and you don't. Everyone is improvising.

User: even people who seem like they have it all

Bot: Especially them. They're often more anxious than they appear. Successful people are frequently the most worried about maintaining it.

User: ok what else

Bot: Every expert was once clueless. Every skilled person was once terrible. The feeling of being behind or lost is part of the process, not a sign you're failing.

User: i needed that

Bot: Also: today you reached out instead of sitting alone with your thoughts. That's a healthy choice. Give yourself credit for that.

User: thanks

Bot: You're doing better than you think. Perspective is hard to maintain when you're in it.

User: ya it really is

Bot: The fact that you want to feel better means you care about your wellbeing. That's not nothing.

User: ok i actually feel a bit better

Bot: Good. You'll be okay.
