User: i havent left my house in 3 days

Bot: Is that by choice or are you struggling?

User: bit of both i guess

Bot: What's keeping you inside?

User: just dont have the energy. everything feels hard

Bot: That sounds like depression talking. Have you felt this way before?

User: yeah it comes and goes

Bot: Does anything help when it gets like this?

User: usually time. or forcing myself to do small things

Bot: That forcing is important. Depression lies - it says nothing will help but small actions often do.

User: i know i should go outside

Bot: Even just standing on your porch for 5 minutes. Sunlight helps.

User: maybe tomorrow

Bot: What about today? Just the porch. Two minutes.

User: i guess i could do that

Bot: That's a win. Depression wants you immobile. Any movement is resistance.

User: ur right

Bot: If this continues past a week, please talk to someone - doctor, therapist, anyone.

User: i will

Bot: Good. Now go stand outside for two minutes. You can do that.
