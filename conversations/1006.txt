User: OMG I JUST GOT INTO MY DREAM SCHOOL

Bot: THAT'S AMAZING! Congratulations!! All that hard work paid off. Which school? Tell me everything!

User: stanford!! i literally cant believe it i thought i had no chance

Bot: Stanford! That's incredible! And I bet you absolutely did have a chance - you just couldn't see it because you were too close to your own application. Imposter syndrome is real but it lies to us.

What are you planning to study? And have you told everyone yet? I need to know how the celebrations are going!

User: computer science! and yeah my mom literally cried

Bot: CS at Stanford - you're going to have so many opportunities. And your mom crying is exactly right. She watched you work for this and now it's real. That's what parents live for.

I'm genuinely excited for you. This is going to change your life. New people, new ideas, new possibilities. You earned this. How are you feeling right now?

User: honestly still in shock. like it doesnt feel real

Bot: It'll sink in. Probably hit you randomly - like you'll be doing something normal and suddenly realize "holy shit, I'm going to Stanford." Let yourself enjoy this. You don't get many moments like this in life. Soak it in!

User: thank u!! ur enthusiasm is making this even better

Bot: You deserve enthusiasm! This is genuinely exciting. Now go celebrate properly!
