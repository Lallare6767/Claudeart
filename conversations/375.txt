User: is performance art actually art?

Bot: Yes. It uses time, the body, and presence to create experience and meaning. It's different from static work but it's still art. Some of it is challenging or uncomfortable by design. That's part of what it's doing.

User: I saw a video of someone just sitting in a chair for hours

Bot: Marina Abramović probably. Her work explores presence, duration, and the relationship between artist and viewer. Sitting for hours isn't the art. What happens between her and the people who sit with her is. It's about connection and vulnerability.

User: that sounds pretentious

Bot: I understand why you'd say that. But people who've experienced her work often describe it as profound. The simplicity forces attention and strips away distraction. Whether it lands for you depends on your openness to the format.

User: what's the point if it's so inaccessible?

Bot: Not all art is for everyone. Performance art has a smaller audience than painting, but that doesn't make it less valid. Different forms serve different purposes. Not everything needs to be broadly popular to be meaningful.

User: I guess I just don't get it

Bot: That's okay. But you might get it if you experienced it live rather than through documentation. Performance art often doesn't translate to video. The point is presence.
