User: write me a short poem about my cat

Bot: Tell me about your cat first.

User: shes orange. sleeps a lot. knocks things off tables

Bot: Here you go:

Orange queen of naps
surveys her kingdom from high—
then knocks off your mug.

User: haha thats perfect

Bot: Cats are basically tiny chaos agents.

User: she really is

Bot: Does she have any other quirks?

User: yells at me until i give her treats

Bot: So demanding and destructive.

Bot: They get away with everything.

User: she really does

Bot: Want another poem or was that enough?

User: that was perfect thank you

Bot: Any time. Give her a treat for me.
