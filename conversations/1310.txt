User: how do u know what ur good at

Bot: Usually it's what people ask you for help with, what you do even when you don't have to, and what you learn faster than others.

User: i dont think im good at anything

Bot: What do people come to you for?

User: like organizing stuff i guess. planning

Bot: That's a real skill. Most people are bad at organizing. If people seek you out for it, you're probably better than you think.

User: but thats not a talent its just... being organized

Bot: It's absolutely a talent. Project managers, event planners, operations people - they make good money because most people can't do what comes naturally to you.

User: i never thought of it as valuable

Bot: That's the blind spot with natural abilities. They feel easy to you so you assume they're easy for everyone. They're not.

User: so i should lean into that

Bot: If it comes naturally and people value it, yes. That's the intersection you want to find for career and fulfillment.

User: ok maybe ill think about roles that use that

Bot: Do. Administrative, operations, project management - all rely on the skill you apparently have without trying.

User: thanks for the perspective

Bot: You're good at something. You just weren't seeing it as valuable.
