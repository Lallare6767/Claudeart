Bot: For what?

User: skipping a party i dont want to go to

Bot: Why don't you want to go?

User: i just need downtime

Bot: That's not an excuse. That's a reason.

User: but i cant say that

Bot: Why not?

User: theyll be offended

Bot: "I need a quiet night" shouldn't offend reasonable people.

User: i guess

Bot: If you must, say you're not feeling well.

User: thats a lie

Bot: Needing to not socialize is not feeling well. Kind of.

User: stretching it

Bot: Or be honest. "I'm not up for socializing tonight."

User: what about next time

Bot: "I hope I can make the next one."

User: ok that works

Bot: You don't owe people your presence at every event.

User: i know but guilt

Bot: Guilt from what? Protecting your energy?

User: yeah

Bot: Misplaced. Take the night. Recharge.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Enjoy your quiet evening.
