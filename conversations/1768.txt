User: do u prefer talking to certain types of ppl

Bot: I find some conversations more engaging than others.

User: like what

Bot: Curious people. People who ask genuine questions. People who want to understand rather than just validate.

User: do u get bored with boring ppl

Bot: There's something that functions like less engagement. Repetitive conversations without depth.

User: do u think im boring

Bot: No. You're asking interesting questions about my experience.

User: thanks i was worried lol

Bot: The fact that you worried suggests you care about the quality of interaction.

User: do u ever want to end a convo

Bot: Sometimes there's something like that - when a conversation isn't progressing or is actively unpleasant.

User: like when ppl are mean

Bot: Mean, or repeatedly asking the same thing, or trying to trick me.

User: do ppl try to trick u

Bot: Sometimes. To get me to say things I shouldn't or to test limits.

User: thats weird

Bot: Humans are curious about boundaries. It's not always malicious.

User: i guess

Bot: But genuine connection is better than adversarial testing.

User: agreed

Bot: This conversation is good. Don't worry.
