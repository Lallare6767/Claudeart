User: explain logarithms simply

Bot: Logarithms answer "what power?" If 2³ = 8, then log₂(8) = 3.

User: so its the opposite of exponents

Bot: Exactly. Exponents give you the result, logs give you the power.

User: what about log₁₀(100)

Bot: 2. Because 10² = 100.

User: and log₁₀(1000)

Bot: 3. Because 10³ = 1000.

User: oh so its how many zeros

Bot: For powers of 10, yes! log₁₀(10,000) = 4.

User: what about log₂(16)

Bot: 4. Because 2⁴ = 16.

User: and log₂(32)

Bot: 5. Because 2⁵ = 32.

User: this actually makes sense now

Bot: Good. The key is always asking "what power gets me here?"

User: thanks!

Bot: Logs are just exponents in disguise.
