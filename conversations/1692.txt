User: if i have $500 and spend 23% how much do i have left

Bot: $385.

User: show me

Bot: 23% of $500 = $115. $500 - $115 = $385.

User: what if i spend 17% of that

Bot: $319.55.

User: wait how

Bot: 17% of $385 = $65.45. $385 - $65.45 = $319.55.

User: ok what if i add 10% back

Bot: $351.51.

User: how did u get that

Bot: 10% of $319.55 = $31.96 (rounded). $319.55 + $31.96 = $351.51.

User: so percentages work on whatever the current number is

Bot: Exactly. Each percentage operates on the current value, not the original.

User: that makes sense

Bot: It's why compound interest is powerful - each iteration builds on the previous total.

User: thanks for the practice

Bot: Anytime. Percentages are everywhere in real life.
