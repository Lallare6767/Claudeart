User: im learning to trust myself again

Bot: Again? What happened?

User: i made bad decisions for a while. lost faith in my judgment

Bot: What kind of decisions?

User: relationships mostly. kept picking wrong people

Bot: That can definitely shake your confidence.

User: i didnt trust myself to choose anymore

Bot: And now?

User: im trying to listen to my gut again

Bot: Has it been accurate lately?

User: yeah actually. small things but its been right

Bot: That's how you rebuild. Small confirmations.

User: i second guess myself constantly though

Bot: That's the old habit. Takes time to fade.

User: frustrating

Bot: But you're aware of it. That's step one.

User: i want to trust myself like i used to

Bot: You might never be that certain again. But informed confidence is better anyway.
