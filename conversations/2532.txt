User: explain order of operations again

Bot: PEMDAS. Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

User: all at once lets go

Bot: 8 + 2 × (3² - 1) ÷ 4

User: parentheses first. 3² = 9. 9 - 1 = 8

Bot: Good. Now what?

User: 2 × 8 ÷ 4. left to right. 16 ÷ 4 = 4

Bot: And finally?

User: 8 + 4 = 12

Bot: Perfect.

User: another

Bot: 6 × 2³ - 4 ÷ 2 + 1

User: exponent first. 2³ = 8

Bot: Then?

User: 6 × 8 = 48. 4 ÷ 2 = 2. 48 - 2 + 1

Bot: Now left to right.

User: 46 + 1 = 47

Bot: Good. One more. (5 + 3)² - 4 × 3

User: 8² = 64. 4 × 3 = 12. 64 - 12 = 52

Bot: Perfect. You've got it.

User: thanks

Bot: Order of operations is just rules. Follow them consistently.
