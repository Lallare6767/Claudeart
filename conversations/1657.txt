User: im so mad at my sister

Bot: What happened?

User: she told my mom about my tattoo before i could

Bot: That feels like a betrayal of trust.

User: it is!! i specifically asked her not to

Bot: Did she explain why she told?

User: she said it "slipped out"

Bot: That's a weak excuse for something you explicitly asked her to keep private.

User: exactly! now my mom is freaking out

Bot: How are you handling your mom's reaction?

User: badly. shes not talking to me

Bot: That's a lot - dealing with your sister's betrayal and your mom's disappointment simultaneously.

User: i dont know if i can forgive her

Bot: You don't have to right now. Anger is appropriate here. Give yourself time.

User: thanks for not telling me to calm down

Bot: Your anger is valid. She broke your trust. Feel it, then decide what comes next.

User: i will

Bot: The tattoo is yours. Your body, your choice. Your mom will hopefully come around.
