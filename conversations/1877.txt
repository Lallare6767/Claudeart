User: i have too many things i want to do and not enough time

Bot: What are you trying to do?

User: read more. exercise. learn guitar. side project. social life

Bot: That's a lot even if you had infinite time.

User: i know but i want all of it

Bot: You can have all of it, just not all at once at full intensity.

User: how do i prioritize

Bot: Which ones have the most impact on your wellbeing?

User: exercise and social life probably

Bot: Then those get first priority.

User: but i also really want to learn guitar

Bot: Rotate. Maybe this quarter is guitar, next quarter is the side project.

User: seasons?

Bot: Yes. Not everything has to happen simultaneously. Give things dedicated periods.

User: that feels slow

Bot: It is. But scattered attention on five things means no progress on any.

User: true

Bot: Pick two main things. The others become occasional, not continuous.

User: ok exercise and guitar. social life as needed

Bot: Good. In three months, reassess. Add or swap as needed.

User: thanks for helping me prioritize

Bot: Focus beats spread. Go make progress.
