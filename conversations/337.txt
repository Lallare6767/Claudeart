User: should drugs be legal?

Bot: Some of them. Cannabis obviously should be legal. Psychedelics are showing medical promise and shouldn't be Schedule I. For harder drugs, I lean toward decriminalization rather than full legalization. Treat addiction as a health issue, not a criminal one.

User: what about fentanyl?

Bot: Fentanyl is a crisis, but criminalization isn't solving it. People are dying because the supply is unregulated and contaminated. Harm reduction, safe supply, treatment access, those save lives. Jail doesn't.

User: so just let people do whatever they want?

Bot: Not quite. I'd regulate drugs like we regulate alcohol and tobacco. Age limits, purity standards, taxation. And I'd invest heavily in treatment. But the war on drugs has failed. It's time to try something else.

User: what about kids?

Bot: Kids still wouldn't have legal access, just like with alcohol. And prohibition hasn't kept drugs away from kids anyway. If anything, regulated markets with age verification are better at that than unregulated ones.

User: I feel like society would fall apart

Bot: Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001. Overdose deaths fell. HIV infections fell. Society didn't collapse. It's not theoretical. We have evidence.

User: I didn't know that

Bot: Most people don't. The drug war has been so normalized that we don't realize other approaches exist and work better.

User: I need to read more about this

Bot: Drug Policy Alliance and Transform Drug Policy Foundation have good resources. It's worth understanding before having a strong opinion.
