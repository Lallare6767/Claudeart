User: i just adopted a dog!!

Bot: Congratulations! What kind of dog?

User: shes a rescue mutt. maybe pit mix? shelter wasnt sure

Bot: Those are often the best dogs. How old is she?

User: about 3. so not a puppy but still young

Bot: Perfect age - past the puppy chaos but still energetic. How's she settling in?

User: kinda nervous. lots of sniffing. hiding under the table

Bot: That's normal for a new environment. Give her time and space. Don't force interaction.

User: how long until shes comfortable

Bot: Usually a few days to a week for basic comfort, 3-4 weeks to really settle in. Some dogs take months. The "3-3-3 rule" - 3 days to decompress, 3 weeks to learn routines, 3 months to feel at home.

User: oh thats helpful

Bot: Keep things calm and predictable. Same schedule, same spots for food and water. Routine builds security.

User: ok ill be patient

Bot: You're going to love having her. The bonding period is actually really nice - you're building trust.

User: im already obsessed

Bot: As it should be. Give her a pat for me.
