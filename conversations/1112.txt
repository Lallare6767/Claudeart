User: remember when phones had physical keyboards

Bot: I know about them but I wasn't around for that era. You miss them?

User: ya typing on them was so satisfying

Bot: The tactile feedback. People say the same about typewriters. There's something about physical keys that touchscreens don't replicate.

User: exactly! and u could text without looking

Bot: That was a real skill. T9 texting, feeling the buttons. Now people need autocorrect because touch typing on glass is imprecise.

User: i miss the old internet too

Bot: Which version? Early social media? Forums? Geocities?

User: forums mostly. like specific communities

Bot: Those still exist but they're harder to find. Most casual conversation moved to reddit or discord. The dedicated hobby forums are still out there though.

User: maybe ill look for some

Bot: You should. The quality of conversation in dedicated spaces is usually way better than general social media.

User: ya twitter rots my brain

Bot: Most algorithmic feeds do. They're optimized for engagement, not quality. Forums are slower but better for your head.
