User: is it weird that im 28 and still dont know what i want to do

Bot: Not weird at all. That's a very common experience.

User: everyone else seems to have it figured out

Bot: They're either pretending or they got lucky finding something early. Neither means you're behind.

User: i just feel lost

Bot: Lost is uncomfortable but not permanent. What have you tried?

User: a few different jobs. nothing sticks

Bot: What did you like about any of them?

User: i liked the parts where i helped people. hated the paperwork

Bot: That's useful information. Something service-oriented with less admin.

User: i guess thats a clue

Bot: More clues come from trying things. You learn what you want by ruling out what you don't.

User: its just slow

Bot: It is. But rushing into the wrong thing is slower - then you have to start over.

User: thats true

Bot: You're not behind. You're gathering information. Keep going.

User: thanks

Bot: The clarity will come. Usually when you stop forcing it.
