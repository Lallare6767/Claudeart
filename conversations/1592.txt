User: i think i have seasonal depression

Bot: What symptoms are you noticing?

User: low energy, sleeping more, not wanting to do anything. only in winter

Bot: Does it happen every year around the same time?

User: ya. starts in november, lifts in march

Bot: That pattern is textbook SAD - Seasonal Affective Disorder. Have you talked to a doctor?

User: no but i know what theyll say. light box

Bot: They might suggest that, or vitamin D, or antidepressants for the season. All valid options.

User: do light boxes actually work

Bot: For many people yes. You use it in the morning for 20-30 minutes. Mimics sunlight.

User: what else helps

Bot: Exercise even though you don't feel like it, maintaining social contact even though you want to isolate, keeping consistent sleep schedule.

User: all the things i dont want to do

Bot: Exactly. SAD makes you want to hibernate. Fighting that instinct helps.

User: ugh ok

Bot: Talk to a doctor. There's no reason to white-knuckle through November to March every year.

User: ok ill make an appointment

Bot: Good. Winter doesn't have to feel like that.
