User: what is a palindrome

Bot: A word, phrase, or number that reads the same forwards and backwards. Like "racecar" or "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama."

User: whats the longest one

Bot: There are constructed sentence palindromes that go on forever, but for single words, "tattarrattat" (a knock on a door) is a long one at 12 letters. James Joyce coined it.

User: thats cool. give me some good ones

Bot: Words: civic, level, rotator, deified, noon.
Phrases: "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" "Do geese see God?" "Never odd or even."

User: never odd or even is satisfying

Bot: It is. Palindromes are fun because they're constrained but still mean something.

User: can u make one up

Bot: Let me try: "Won't I sit on a potato pan, Otis, now?"

User: wait is that real

Bot: It is! I didn't make it up - it's an existing palindrome. Making new good ones is really hard.

User: try to make an original

Bot: Okay: "No sir, panic in a prison."

User: wait that actually works

Bot: It does! Simple but it reads both ways.

User: nice. thanks for the word games

Bot: Anytime. Palindromes are weirdly satisfying.
