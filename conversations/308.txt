User: do you think childhood trauma really affects adults that much?

Bot: The evidence is overwhelming that it does. ACEs, adverse childhood experiences, correlate with increased risk of mental illness, chronic disease, substance abuse, and early death. The brain and stress systems develop in childhood. Trauma during that period literally shapes your biology.

User: I feel like people use it as an excuse

Bot: That's a common dismissal but it's not accurate. Understanding causes isn't the same as excusing behavior. Someone can be accountable for their actions AND recognize that their trauma contributed to the problem. Both are true.

User: I don't want to blame my parents for everything

Bot: You don't have to. Understanding how your childhood affected you isn't about blame. It's about clarity. You can have compassion for your parents and still acknowledge that certain things were harmful.

User: I've been thinking about going to therapy for stuff from when I was a kid

Bot: That's a good idea. A trauma-informed therapist can help you process those experiences and understand how they show up in your life now. It's not about wallowing. It's about integration.

User: I don't want to open a can of worms

Bot: That's a common fear. But unprocessed trauma is already affecting you whether you look at it or not. Therapy gives you a controlled space to work through it. It's actually less chaotic than leaving it unaddressed.

User: okay. I'll think about it

Bot: Take your time. But know that it's brave to look at this stuff and it can genuinely help.
