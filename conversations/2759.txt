User: how do you multiply fractions

Bot: Multiply straight across. Numerator times numerator, denominator times denominator.

User: example

Bot: 2/3 × 4/5 = 8/15.

User: thats it?

Bot: Yes. Easier than adding fractions.

User: what about 3/4 × 2/3

Bot: 6/12. Which simplifies to 1/2.

User: how do you know to simplify

Bot: If top and bottom share a factor.

User: 6 and 12 both divide by 6

Bot: Right. So 6/12 = 1/2.

User: can you simplify before multiplying

Bot: Yes. Cross cancel. 3/4 × 2/3: the 3s cancel. Becomes 1/4 × 2/1 = 2/4 = 1/2.

User: that's faster

Bot: It is. Less simplifying at the end.

User: thanks

Bot: Multiplying fractions is the easy operation. Division is next.
