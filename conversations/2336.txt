User: whats an allegory

Bot: A story where characters and events represent something else. Usually abstract ideas.

User: like a metaphor

Bot: Extended metaphor. The whole story is the metaphor.

User: example?

Bot: Animal Farm. The animals represent different parts of Soviet society.

User: oh i read that

Bot: The pigs are the ruling class. The farmer is the tsar. It's all representing real history.

User: so its like a code

Bot: Kind of. A way to talk about something dangerous or complex through a safe story.

User: any others

Bot: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan represents Christ.

User: i didnt know that

Bot: CS Lewis was religious. The resurrection imagery is intentional.

User: allegories are everywhere then

Bot: Literature, film, art. Once you see the pattern, you see it everywhere.

User: is every story an allegory

Bot: No. Some are just stories. Allegories have intentional symbolic meaning throughout.

User: how do u tell

Bot: Sometimes the author says. Sometimes it's obvious. Sometimes it's interpretation.

User: cool

Bot: Look for patterns. If elements keep representing the same thing, probably allegory.
