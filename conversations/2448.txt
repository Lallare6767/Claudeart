User: whats an acute angle

User: and reflex

Bot: More than 180 but less than 360.

User: how do i remember

Bot: Acute sounds like "cute"—small. Obtuse sounds like "obese"—big.

User: lol thats terrible but works

Bot: Whatever sticks.

User: what about 90 exactly

Bot: Right angle. The square symbol marks it.

User: complementary and supplementary again

Bot: Complementary add to 90. Supplementary add to 180.

User: so two complementary acute angles

Bot: Yes. Two supplementary could be one acute and one obtuse.

User: or two right angles

Bot: Yes. 90 + 90 = 180.

User: this is clearer now

Bot: Angles are foundational. These terms come up constantly.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice identifying them visually. It helps.
