User: im so excited for my trip next week

Bot: Where are you going?

User: japan! first time. 2 weeks

Bot: Two weeks is great - enough time to see multiple regions without rushing. What's on your itinerary?

User: tokyo kyoto osaka and maybe hiroshima

Bot: Solid choices. The classics for a first trip. Are you more interested in temples, food, city life, nature?

User: honestly everything. but especially food

Bot: Then you're going to the right place. Japan has some of the best food culture in the world. Any specific things you want to try?

User: ramen sushi wagyu. the basics

Bot: Those basics are exceptional there. Also try conveyor belt sushi, depachika (department store food halls), and random hole-in-the-wall spots.

User: whats depachika

Bot: Basement floors of department stores with incredible prepared foods, sweets, and samples. It's an experience.

User: adding that to the list

Bot: You're going to have an amazing time. Japan is one of those places that usually exceeds expectations.

User: i cant wait

Bot: Safe travels! Enjoy every bit of it.
