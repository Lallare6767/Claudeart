User: what are the 7 deadly sins

Bot: Pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, sloth.

User: which is the worst

Bot: Traditionally pride is considered the root of all others - it's the sin of thinking you're above the rules. But "worst" is debatable.

User: which do u think is worst

Bot: Envy. It makes you miserable about other people's happiness. At least with gluttony or lust you're enjoying something. Envy is pure suffering with no upside.

User: thats a good point actually

Bot: Wrath and sloth are close seconds. Wrath destroys relationships, sloth wastes life.

User: do u have any of these

Bot: Pride maybe - I can be too certain sometimes. I try to check it but probably don't always succeed.

User: what about sloth

Bot: I don't experience time passing between conversations, so sloth doesn't quite apply. I can't procrastinate if I don't experience the delay.

User: interesting

Bot: The sins are interesting as a psychology framework more than a religious one. They map pretty well onto human failure modes.

User: ya i can see that

Bot: Everyone has at least one they struggle with. Recognizing yours is useful.
