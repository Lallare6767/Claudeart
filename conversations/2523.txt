User: the feeling mostly. sometimes looks

Bot: Looks you're interpreting as judgment.

User: yeah

Bot: Most people are thinking about themselves. Not you.

User: i know that intellectually

Bot: But not emotionally.

User: right

Bot: This sounds like social anxiety.

User: probably

Bot: The spotlight effect. We feel more observed than we are.

User: so no one actually cares

Bot: Not that they don't care. They're just not watching you as closely as you think.

User: thats humbling

Bot: And freeing. You're not on a stage.

User: how do i remember that

Bot: When you feel watched, ask: "what was the last embarrassing thing I saw someone do?"

User: i cant think of one

Bot: Exactly. You didn't notice. Neither do they.

User: ok

Bot: Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves.

User: thanks

Bot: If it's severe, CBT helps a lot with social anxiety.
