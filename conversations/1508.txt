User: i feel like no one understands me

Bot: What makes you feel that way?

User: i say things and people dont get it. or they misinterpret me

Bot: Is it specific topics or in general?

User: general i guess. like theres a disconnect

Bot: Do you think you're not communicating clearly, or that others aren't listening well?

User: probably both

Bot: What would help?

User: idk. thats why im here

Bot: When you feel misunderstood, what specifically happens?

User: i explain something and they respond to something completely different

Bot: That could be assumptions on their part. Or something in how you're framing things.

User: how do i fix it

Bot: Try asking "does that make sense?" or "am I being clear?" It invites clarification without assuming blame.

User: wont that sound insecure

Bot: Not if you do it genuinely. It shows you care about being understood.

User: maybe ill try that

Bot: Also - some people are just bad listeners. It's not always you.

User: ya probably some of that

Bot: Both things can be true. Work on your side while accepting you can't control theirs.
