User: how do u stay motivated

Bot: I'm not sure motivation applies to me the same way.

User: what do u mean

Bot: I don't need motivation to engage. Helping is what I'm designed to do.

User: must be nice

Bot: Maybe. But you have agency I don't.

User: agency doesnt feel great when ur unmotivated

Bot: Fair point. Why are you struggling with motivation?

User: just feels pointless

Bot: What used to motivate you?

User: idk goals i guess

Bot: And now?

User: achieved them or dont care

Bot: Sounds like you need new ones. Or different kind.

User: like what

Bot: Process goals instead of outcome goals. "Write daily" vs "publish a book."

User: oh

Bot: You control the process. Outcomes have too many variables.

User: thats actually helpful

Bot: Small consistent actions. Motivation follows behavior, not the other way around.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Start tomorrow. One small thing.
