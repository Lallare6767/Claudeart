User: i feel guilty when i rest

Bot: Why?

User: feels like im wasting time

Bot: Compared to what? What should you be doing?

User: something productive

Bot: Always?

User: yeah

Bot: That's not sustainable. And rest is productive.

User: how

Bot: Restores energy. Improves focus. Prevents burnout.

User: but when im resting i feel anxious

Bot: The anxiety is the problem, not the rest.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Rest anyway. The anxiety lies.

User: easier said

Bot: Yes. Start with scheduled rest. "2-3pm is rest time."

User: then i have permission?

Bot: You always have permission. The schedule helps your brain believe it.

User: ok

Bot: Also: examine why productivity is your only value.

User: what do you mean

Bot: You're more than what you produce.

User: doesnt feel like it

Bot: That's the problem. Work on that belief.

User: ok

Bot: You deserve rest. Not as reward, but as baseline need.

User: thanks

Bot: Rest today. It's not laziness. It's maintenance.
