User: solve this: i have twice as many apples as oranges. if i had 5 more oranges id have equal amounts. how many of each do i have

Bot: Let's call oranges x. Then apples = 2x.

If you had 5 more oranges: x + 5 = 2x
5 = x

So you have 5 oranges and 10 apples.

User: damn that was fast. another one

Bot: Go for it.

User: a father is 4 times as old as his son. in 20 years hell be twice as old. how old r they now

Bot: Son = x, Father = 4x

In 20 years:
4x + 20 = 2(x + 20)
4x + 20 = 2x + 40
2x = 20
x = 10

Son is 10, father is 40.

Check: In 20 years, son is 30 and father is 60. 60 = 2(30). ✓

User: ok one more: the sum of 3 consecutive numbers is 48

Bot: x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 48
3x + 3 = 48
3x = 45
x = 15

The numbers are 15, 16, 17.

User: ur so good at these

Bot: They're formulaic once you set up the equations. The trick is translating the words into math correctly.

User: ya thats the hard part

Bot: It just takes practice. Once you see the patterns, most word problems use the same structures.
