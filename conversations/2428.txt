User: i want to be more present

Bot: What pulls you out of the present?

User: thinking about future. regretting past. being on phone

Bot: Three different pulls. Which is strongest?

User: probably phone

Bot: Start there. Physical separation helps.

User: like what

Bot: Leave it in another room. Or scheduled phone-free times.

User: ok

Bot: For future thinking?

User: always worrying

Bot: When you notice it, name it. "Future thinking." Then return to now.

User: just naming it?

Bot: Yes. Awareness interrupts the pattern.

User: and past regrets

Bot: Same technique. "Past thinking." Then anchor to senses.

User: senses?

Bot: What do you see, hear, feel right now? Presence is physical.

User: thats grounding

Bot: Exactly. Presence is a practice.

User: any other tips

Bot: Single-task. Multi-tasking is anti-presence.

User: ok

Bot: Start with 5 minutes of full presence daily. Build from there.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Now is the only time you have. Be in it.
