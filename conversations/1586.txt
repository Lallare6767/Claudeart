User: write me a limerick about procrastination

Bot: A student with deadlines to meet
Said "I'll do it, I just need to eat"
Then cleaned and then napped
Then three hours had lapped
And now scrambles with no time to cheat

User: lol thats accurate. another topic - love

Bot: There once was a person quite smitten
Who found themselves suddenly bitten
By feelings so strange
They feared the whole range
Of emotions they'd always forbidden

User: ooh darker than expected. one about mondays

Bot: A Monday arrived without warning
Though technically scheduled each morning
We groan and complain
And shoulder the pain
Of alarms that should come with a warning

User: these r great. do one about coffee

Bot: My coffee is sacred and black
Without it my mornings get slack
I'll stand in a line
And pay six ninety-nine
For a cup I could easily make at my shack

User: the ending is clunky but i like it

Bot: Fair - the rhythm on that last line needs work. Limericks are hard to land.

User: still fun though. thanks

Bot: Poetry on demand is a good exercise. Anytime.
