User: whats the difference between area and perimeter

Bot: Area is inside. Perimeter is around.

User: so area is square units

Bot: Yes. Square feet, square meters.

User: and perimeter is just feet

Bot: Right. Linear measurement.

User: for a rectangle

Bot: Area = length × width. Perimeter = 2(length + width).

User: example

Bot: Rectangle 3 × 5. Area = 15 square units. Perimeter = 16 units.

User: what about a circle

Bot: Area = πr². Circumference (perimeter) = 2πr.

User: why different formulas

Bot: Different shapes have different relationships. But concept is same.

User: always inside vs around

Bot: Exactly.

User: for irregular shapes

Bot: Break into pieces or use calculus.

User: thats advanced

Bot: But the concept holds. Area = space inside. Perimeter = distance around.

User: when do i need each

Bot: Carpet shopping? Area. Fence building? Perimeter.

User: oh practical

Bot: Very. These come up constantly.

User: thanks!

Bot: Remember: area = covering, perimeter = bordering.
