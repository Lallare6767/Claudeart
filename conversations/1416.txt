User: i just want to feel normal

Bot: What does normal feel like to you?

User: like other people. not constantly anxious

Bot: Anxiety makes you feel like an outsider, but more people experience it than you'd think. They're just not showing it.

User: i guess but i still feel broken

Bot: Anxiety isn't broken. It's your nervous system being overactive. It's treatable.

User: ive tried stuff

Bot: Like what?

User: apps. breathing exercises. they help a little

Bot: What about therapy or medication? Those have the strongest evidence for anxiety.

User: scared of medication

Bot: What specifically worries you?

User: side effects. changing who i am

Bot: Valid concerns. But anxiety is also changing who you are - keeping you from things you want to do. Worth discussing with a doctor what the actual tradeoffs are.

User: maybe

Bot: "Normal" might be unrealistic as a goal. "Better" is achievable. Less anxious, more capable, more present.

User: ok better sounds good

Bot: Start there. You don't have to be perfect. Just improved.
