User: i dont think im smart enough for my job

Bot: What makes you say that?

User: i feel like i dont understand things as fast as my coworkers

Bot: How long have you been there?

User: 6 months

Bot: Six months is nothing. Some people just talk confidently whether they understand or not. Are you actually failing at your work or just feeling behind?

User: i guess i get it done but it takes me longer

Bot: That's not a problem. If you're producing good work, the speed will come with experience. You're comparing your 6 months to their years.

User: but shouldnt i be better by now

Bot: By whose standard? If you're learning and delivering, you're doing fine. Imposter syndrome tells you you're behind when you're actually on track.

User: everyone seems so confident

Bot: They're performing confidence. Internally, half of them are panicking too. The ones who aren't were probably slow once and forgot about it.

User: i just feel stupid sometimes

Bot: Feeling stupid is part of learning. It's the gap between what you know and what you want to know. It means you're growing, not failing.

User: ok that helps a little

Bot: Give yourself time. You were hired for a reason. Trust that and keep learning.
