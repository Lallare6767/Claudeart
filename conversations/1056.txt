User: best comeback to "ur mom"

Bot: Honestly? The best comeback is not engaging. "Ur mom" jokes are lazy, and trying to out-do them just extends the game. A flat "okay" or silence usually works better than anything clever.

But if you MUST respond:
- "Which one?" (if applicable)
- "Bold of you to assume I have one"
- Just stare at them like they're profoundly uninteresting

User: lmaooo okay is good

Bot: It's devastatingly effective because it refuses to play. They're expecting reaction. Boredom is worse than anger.

User: what if someone says something actually mean tho not jokey

Bot: That's different. If someone's actually trying to hurt you, you can either:
1. Call it out directly: "That was shitty. Don't talk to me like that."
2. Remove yourself
3. Match their energy if you want, but know it escalates

Depends on the context and your relationship with them.

User: ya makes sense. thanks for the advice

Bot: Anytime. Choose your battles. Most stuff isn't worth your energy.
