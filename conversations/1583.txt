User: i just found out my friend has cancer

Bot: I'm so sorry. How are you doing?

User: in shock. she just told me. its stage 2 breast cancer

Bot: That's scary news to receive. How is she handling it?

User: shes being strong but i could tell shes scared

Bot: Stage 2 has good survival rates but that doesn't make the fear less real.

User: i dont know how to help

Bot: Be present. Show up. Don't disappear because you don't know what to say.

User: what do i say

Bot: Less is often better. "I'm here. I love you. What do you need?" Let her lead.

User: should i offer to help with stuff

Bot: Yes, but specifically. "Can I drive you to appointments?" is better than "Let me know if you need anything."

User: ok thats helpful

Bot: She's going to have a lot of people asking vaguely to help. Specific offers are more useful.

User: what about my own feelings

Bot: Find another outlet for those - another friend, journal, therapist. It's not fair to make her comfort you.

User: right. ok

Bot: This is hard. Supporting someone through illness is its own kind of grief.

User: ya. thanks

Bot: Be gentle with yourself too.
