User: help me write a message asking a friend to pay me back

Bot: How much and how long has it been?

User: $200 and like 3 months

Bot: That's long enough to ask directly. How close are you with this friend?

User: pretty close but this is awkward

Bot: "Hey, not trying to make it weird, but can you Venmo me back that $200 from a while ago? Let me know if you need to split it up or anything."

User: is that too passive

Bot: Maybe slightly. Here's more direct: "Hey, can you send me that $200 back? I need to sort out some stuff and that would help."

User: ya i like that better

Bot: Good. Adding the reason makes it feel less like an accusation and more like a practical request.

User: what if they still dont pay

Bot: Then follow up in a week. "Hey, following up on that $200." If they keep dodging, you've learned something about this person.

User: ugh i hate money stuff

Bot: Everyone does. But $200 is real money. It's worth the awkwardness to get back.

User: ok sending it now. wish me luck

Bot: Good luck. Most people just forget - a direct ask usually works.
