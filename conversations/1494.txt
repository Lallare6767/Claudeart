User: what are the primary colors

Bot: Depends on the context. For light (additive): red, green, blue. For paint/pigment (subtractive): red, yellow, blue - or more accurately cyan, magenta, yellow.

User: why different

Bot: Light combines to make white (additive). Paint absorbs light, so mixing takes away colors (subtractive).

User: which one did i learn in school

Bot: Probably red, yellow, blue. That's traditional art education. It works but isn't technically accurate.

User: wait its wrong?

Bot: Not wrong for practical painting, but the true subtractive primaries are cyan, magenta, yellow - that's why printers use CMY.

User: mind blown

Bot: Red, yellow, blue was simplified for kids. Cyan, magenta, yellow give you a wider color gamut.

User: why do computer screens use RGB

Bot: Because screens emit light. Red, green, blue light at full intensity makes white.

User: and turning them all off is black

Bot: Exactly. It's the absence of light.

User: colors are more complicated than i thought

Bot: They really are. Color theory is deep.

User: thanks for the lesson

Bot: Anytime. It's fun stuff once you dig into it.
