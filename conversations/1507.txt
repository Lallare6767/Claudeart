User: whats 30% off $249.99

Bot: $175. (Actually $174.99 if we're exact.)

User: round it

Bot: $175.

User: what would tax be at 9%

Bot: $175 × 1.09 = $190.75.

User: so i save almost $75

Bot: Before tax, yes. After tax you're paying $190.75 instead of about $272.49.

User: wait whats full price with tax

Bot: $249.99 × 1.09 = $272.49.

User: so i save about $82 total

Bot: Exactly. The discount saves you more when you account for not paying tax on that amount either.

User: i never thought about that

Bot: Tax compounds on whatever you pay. Lower price = less tax. Double savings.

User: should i buy it

Bot: I don't know what it is.

User: a mixer for baking

Bot: Do you bake often? Will you use it?

User: ya pretty often

Bot: Then $175 for something you'll use regularly is probably worth it.

User: ok sold. thanks for doing the math

Bot: Happy baking!
