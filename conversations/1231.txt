User: im addicted to my phone and i need to stop

Bot: What specifically are you addicted to - social media, games, just scrolling?

User: mostly social media and youtube

Bot: Those are designed to be addictive. What's the impact on your life?

User: i waste hours every day and i cant focus on anything

Bot: Delete the apps. Not willpower, deletion. You can still access through browser if you really need to, but the friction matters.

User: i tried that but i just redownload them

Bot: Then use screen time limits with a password you don't know. Have someone else set it.

User: that feels extreme

Bot: Your addiction is extreme. You're losing hours every day to something that makes you feel worse. Match the solution to the problem.

User: ya fair

Bot: Also: fill the time with something else. You'll reach for your phone when you're bored. Have a book, a walk, anything that isn't the phone.

User: i dont know what to do with myself without it

Bot: That's concerning and also common. We've trained ourselves to need constant stimulation. Relearning to be bored takes time but it's worth it.

User: ok im gonna try the screen time thing

Bot: Good. The first week will be hard. After that it gets easier. Your attention will come back.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. You're taking your brain back.
