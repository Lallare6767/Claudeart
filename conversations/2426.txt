User: help me find the mean of 5 7 8 12 18

Bot: Add them up and divide by count.

User: 5+7+8+12+18 = 50

Bot: And how many numbers?

User: 5

Bot: So mean = 50/5 = 10.

User: easy. now median

Bot: Middle number when sorted. Already sorted: 5, 7, 8, 12, 18.

User: so 8

Bot: Correct. Third out of five.

User: what if there were 6 numbers

Bot: Average of the two middle ones.

User: like 5 7 8 12 18 20

Bot: Middle two are 8 and 12. Median = (8+12)/2 = 10.

User: same as mean here

Bot: Coincidence. They're often different.

User: mode?

Bot: Most frequent. Your original set has no mode—all appear once.

User: if i added another 8

Bot: Then 8 would be the mode.

User: ok this is clear now

Bot: Mean for average. Median for middle. Mode for most common.

User: thanks

Bot: Use the right one for the context. Each tells different story.
