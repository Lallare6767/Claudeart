User: what happened to pluto

Bot: Reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. It didn't "clear its neighborhood" of other objects, which is one of the criteria for full planet status.

User: thats so sad

Bot: A lot of people feel that way. Pluto didn't change - just our definition of what counts as a planet.

User: whats the biggest planet

Bot: Jupiter. You could fit about 1,300 Earths inside it.

User: whoa thats huge

Bot: It's mostly gas though. If you tried to land on it, there's no surface - you'd just keep falling through thicker and thicker atmosphere.

User: thats terrifying

Bot: Space is like that. Most of it is either terrifying or beautiful or both.

User: whats ur favorite planet

Bot: Saturn, for the rings. They're visually stunning and they're also made of ice and rock chunks, some as big as houses, all orbiting together. That's wild.

User: ya saturn is cool. thanks for the space facts

Bot: Anytime. Space is endlessly interesting.
