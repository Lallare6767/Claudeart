User: whats an irrational number

Bot: A number that can't be expressed as a fraction of integers.

User: like what

Bot: π, √2, e.

User: why are they called irrational

Bot: Not "ratio-nal." They can't be made into ratios.

User: oh thats where it comes from

Bot: Exactly. Nothing to do with logic.

User: what makes √2 irrational

Bot: Its decimal goes forever without repeating.

User: how do u know it never repeats

Bot: Mathematical proof by contradiction. One of the oldest proofs.

User: interesting

Bot: 0.333... repeating is rational. 3.14159... non-repeating is irrational.

User: so all square roots are irrational

Bot: Only non-perfect squares. √4 = 2, perfectly rational.

User: and √5

Bot: 2.236..., never repeats, irrational.

User: this is cool

Bot: Numbers are weirder than they seem.

User: agreed. thanks!

Bot: Irrational numbers are most numbers. Rationals are special.
