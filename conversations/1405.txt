User: im really struggling today

Bot: What's going on?

User: just depression stuff. cant get out of bed

Bot: Have you eaten or had water?

User: no

Bot: Can you do that first? Even something small.

User: maybe

Bot: Depression lies to you about everything being pointless. But keeping your body functional isn't pointless - it makes the mental stuff slightly easier.

User: i know all this logically

Bot: I know you do. Knowing and feeling are different things. Right now you don't need to solve everything - just one small step.

User: like what

Bot: Drink water. That's it. That's the whole goal for the next five minutes.

User: ok

Bot: After that, see how you feel about crackers or toast. Tiny steps.

User: this is pathetic

Bot: No. This is what depression looks like. It's not character failure - it's brain chemistry. You're still moving forward even when it's hard.

User: i have a therapist appt tomorrow

Bot: Good. Get through today. Tomorrow you'll have support.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You're doing the right things. It doesn't feel like it, but you are.
