User: i need to practice saying no

Bot: Yes you do. What situation are you facing?

User: people ask me for favors constantly and i always say yes

Bot: And then you resent it?

User: ya exactly

Bot: That resentment is the cost of not saying no. Better to disappoint them upfront than resent them after.

User: but i feel so guilty

Bot: The guilt is temporary. The resentment from overcommitting lasts longer and damages the relationship more.

User: what do i actually say

Bot: "I can't" or "That doesn't work for me." You don't need a reason. If they push, repeat yourself. "Sorry, I can't."

User: what if they get mad

Bot: Some will. But people who get mad when you set boundaries weren't respecting you anyway.

User: ok can i practice on u

Bot: Sure.

User: can u do this favor for me

Bot: I can't, but I hope you find someone who can.

User: that was so easy

Bot: It is easy. The hard part is doing it when you're actually uncomfortable. Practice helps.

User: ok im gonna try this week

Bot: Good. Start with something small. The muscle builds with use.
