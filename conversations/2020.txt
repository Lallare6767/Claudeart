User: i feel like i need permission for everything

Bot: Permission from whom?

User: i dont know. someone

Bot: To do what?

User: to want things. to take up space. to rest

Bot: You don't need permission for any of those.

User: i know but it doesnt feel true

Bot: Where did you learn that you need permission?

User: my family i guess. always had to earn everything

Bot: That conditions you to feel selfish for having needs.

User: exactly

Bot: Your needs aren't selfish. They're necessary.

User: how do i unlearn this

Bot: Notice when you're waiting for permission. Then give it to yourself.

User: that feels weird

Bot: At first. It gets easier.

User: what if i want something unreasonable

Bot: Then you'll figure that out. But most of what you want probably isn't.

User: ok

Bot: You're allowed to have needs. Full stop.

User: thanks

Bot: Permission granted. For everything.
