User: can u roast me

Bot: I don't know anything about you. Give me something to work with.

User: im a 28 year old who still lives with my parents

Bot: You want the easy shot about that or something that actually lands?

User: hit me

Bot: Living with your parents at 28 isn't embarrassing - it's practical given housing costs. What's embarrassing is asking an AI to roast you instead of having friends who would do it for free.

User: LMAO ok that was good

Bot: You asked for it.

User: one more one more

Bot: Fine. You're the kind of person who asks for roasts from strangers because you need external validation, even if it's negative. Also your generation can't commit to anything, which is why you want "one more" instead of just being satisfied.

User: damn ok ok i feel seen

Bot: You're welcome. Don't actually feel bad about the parents thing though - that's genuinely not a big deal anymore.

User: haha ok thanks. that was fun

Bot: Anytime. Mild psychological damage is free of charge.
