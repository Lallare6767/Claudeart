User: i got ghosted after 3 dates

Bot: That's frustrating. How did it go up until then?

User: i thought it went well. they seemed interested

Bot: And then just nothing?

User: texted them about date 4. no response. been a week

Bot: A week is probably ghosting. Sorry.

User: why do people do this

Bot: Easier than having an awkward conversation.

User: its so rude

Bot: It is. You deserved a text at least.

User: i keep wondering what i did wrong

Bot: Maybe nothing. Their reasons might have nothing to do with you.

User: hard to believe that

Bot: Ghosting says more about them than you.

User: i just feel rejected

Bot: That's natural. It sucks.

User: should i text again

Bot: Once more if you want closure. But expect nothing.

User: ok

Bot: Then move on. They're not worth more energy.
