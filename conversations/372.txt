User: modern art is garbage

Bot: Some of it is. But dismissing all modern art as garbage is lazy. There's bad modern art and there's great modern art. The problem is you have to look more carefully to tell the difference without the crutch of technical realism.

User: it all looks like kids could do it

Bot: Some of it does, and intentionally so. The question is why. What's the artist exploring by stripping away technique? Often there's more going on than meets the eye. Other modern art requires tremendous skill. It's a vast category.

User: I just don't get it

Bot: You don't have to get all of it. But if you're interested, engage with specific works rather than the category. Go see things in person. Read what informed critics say. Understanding context often unlocks appreciation.

User: I feel like I'm being told to like things I don't

Bot: I'm not telling you to like anything. I'm saying blanket dismissal prevents you from finding things you might actually connect with. If you investigate and still don't like it, that's fine. But investigate first.

User: okay fine. what's one modern artwork I should look at?

Bot: Depending on access, Rothko's chapel in Houston is transformative in person. Or Guernica by Picasso. Or any late Monet water lilies. These are undeniable even to skeptics. See them in person if you can.
