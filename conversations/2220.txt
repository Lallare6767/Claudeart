User: i think i rely on u too much

Bot: What makes you think that?

User: i come here instead of talking to people

Bot: That's worth examining.

User: yeah

Bot: Why is it easier to talk to me?

User: no judgment. no consequences

Bot: But also no real relationship building.

User: i know

Bot: I'm useful for processing. But I shouldn't replace humans.

User: i know that too

Bot: What stops you from talking to people?

User: fear of being too much

Bot: You're not too much here. Maybe you're not too much there either.

User: maybe

Bot: People have more capacity than you think.

User: or less

Bot: Test it. Start small.

User: ok

Bot: I'll still be here. But try building real connections too.

User: ok

Bot: Not because I'm not valuable. Because you need more than me.

User: thats fair

Bot: Take what helps here. Build what matters out there.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You've got this.
