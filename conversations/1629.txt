User: i hate asking for help

Bot: Why?

User: it feels weak. like i should be able to handle things myself

Bot: Where did that belief come from?

User: probably my parents. they never asked for help either

Bot: So you learned that needing help meant failure.

User: ya i guess

Bot: But you ask for help all the time without thinking of it that way.

User: like what

Bot: You go to doctors, mechanics, hairdressers. You buy things you could theoretically make yourself.

User: thats different

Bot: Is it? Or does it only feel different because emotions aren't involved?

User: hmm

Bot: Asking for emotional help or professional help is just knowing your limits. That's wisdom not weakness.

User: i never thought of it like that

Bot: The most capable people delegate to others' strengths. That's how things get done well.

User: so asking for help is efficient

Bot: Exactly. And it gives other people the chance to contribute. Most people like helping.

User: ok. ill try to reframe it

Bot: Start small. Ask for one thing this week that you'd normally struggle through alone.

User: ok

Bot: Let me know how it goes.
