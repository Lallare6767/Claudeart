User: my anxiety is really bad today

Bot: What's triggering it?

User: nothing specific. just woke up anxious

Bot: That happens. Bodies sometimes have anxiety even without a reason.

User: its hard to function

Bot: Where are you feeling it physically?

User: chest and stomach. racing heart

Bot: Can you try a breathing exercise? 4 counts in, 7 hold, 8 out.

User: ill try

Bot: The exhale being longer than the inhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system.

User: ok doing it now

Bot: Good. A few rounds can help take the edge off.

User: its helping a little

Bot: Good. The goal isn't to eliminate anxiety, just to make it manageable.

User: what do i do for the rest of the day

Bot: Go easy on yourself. Avoid caffeine. Try to move your body if you can.

User: should i cancel plans

Bot: If the plans will make it worse, yes. If they'll distract you, maybe not.

User: ill see how i feel later

Bot: Good plan. And if it doesn't improve, talk to a doctor.

User: ok thank u

Bot: Take care. Anxiety passes.
