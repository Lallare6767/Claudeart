User: i think im addicted to my phone

Bot: What makes you think that?

User: i pick it up constantly without thinking. first thing in the morning, last thing at night

Bot: How many hours do you actually use it?

User: screen time says like 6 hours

Bot: That's significant. What are you doing on it?

User: mostly social media and random browsing. nothing useful

Bot: So it's not the phone - it's the escape it provides.

User: ya. i dont even enjoy it

Bot: Classic addiction pattern. Compulsive use without pleasure.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Make it harder to access. Move apps off home screen, use app limits, leave it in another room.

User: ive tried limits. i just override them

Bot: Then you need physical distance. Phone in another room at night. Not in bathroom. Not at meals.

User: thats hard

Bot: It is. That's why it's an addiction. Easy solutions would have already worked.

User: ok. ill try the other room thing

Bot: Also fill the gap with something else. The phone fills boredom - what can replace it?

User: book maybe

Bot: Good option. Screens are hard to quit. Expect withdrawal feelings.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You can do it. Start small.
