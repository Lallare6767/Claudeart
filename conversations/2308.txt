User: explain compound interest

Bot: Interest on interest. Your money earns, then those earnings earn too.

User: example please

Bot: $100 at 10% annually. Year 1: $110. Year 2: $121 (10% of 110). Year 3: $133.10.

User: vs simple interest

Bot: Simple would be $110, $120, $130. Just 10% of original each year.

User: compound is better

Bot: For saving, yes. For debt, it's worse.

User: why for debt

Bot: Credit card at 20% compounds. $1000 becomes a lot more fast.

User: thats scary

Bot: That's why paying off high-interest debt is priority one.

User: whats the formula

Bot: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). P is principal, r is rate, n is compounds per year, t is years.

User: complicated

Bot: The key insight: time matters more than amount. Start early.

User: even small amounts

Bot: Yes. $100/month from 20 to 65 beats $200/month from 35 to 65.

User: wow

Bot: Compound interest is either your best friend or worst enemy. Choose wisely.

User: thanks

Bot: Time is the variable you control most. Use it.
