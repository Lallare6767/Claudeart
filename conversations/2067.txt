User: how do i stop overthinking

Bot: What are you overthinking about?

User: everything. decisions. conversations. future

Bot: Overthinking is usually about control.

User: what do u mean

Bot: You think if you analyze enough, you can prevent bad outcomes.

User: maybe

Bot: Does it work?

User: no

Bot: So the overthinking is the problem, not the solution.

User: i guess

Bot: Try: notice you're overthinking, then distract or act.

User: how do i distract

Bot: Body stuff. Walk, exercise, cold water on face.

User: and acting

Bot: Make a decision, even imperfect. Action stops loops.

User: but what if i decide wrong

Bot: Most decisions are reversible. And indecision is also a choice.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: Overthinking feels productive. It's not.

User: i know

Bot: Set time limits for decisions. Then decide.

User: ok

Bot: Your first instinct is usually right anyway.
