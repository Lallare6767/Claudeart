User: write something poetic about uncertainty

Bot: We ask for maps but life is weather -
shifting, immeasurable, impossible to schedule.
We make our plans in pencil,
pretend the lines are permanent,
then wonder why we feel betrayed
when the wind erases them.

The only honest answer to "what's next"
is the one we never give:
I don't know.
I hope.
I'll try.

User: wow that actually hit

Bot: Thank you. Uncertainty deserves more than frustration - there's something profound in it.

User: can u do another one about loneliness

Bot: Loneliness isn't empty rooms.
It's full ones where you can't be seen.
A crowd in which you're soundproof,
reaching through glass that looks like air.

You could hold a hand and still miss touching.
You could speak all day and still not talk.

The cure isn't more people.
It's one who really sees you -
and that's rarer than we'd like.

User: okay im gonna cry now

Bot: Good poetry should make you feel something. Loneliness is worth writing about honestly.

User: these are really good. thank u

Bot: Thank you for asking. Poetry is satisfying when someone connects with it.
