User: i keep starting things and not finishing them

Bot: What kinds of things?

User: projects. books. hobbies. everything

Bot: When do you usually stop?

User: when it gets hard or boring

Bot: So the initial excitement fades and you move on.

User: yeah basically

Bot: That's a common pattern. Novelty seeking.

User: how do i fix it

Bot: Commit smaller. Instead of "learn piano," try "learn one song."

User: oh so achievable goals

Bot: Yes. The satisfaction of finishing something builds the muscle for larger projects.

User: i never thought of finishing as a skill

Bot: It is. Different from starting. Requires pushing through the boring middle.

User: the boring middle is where i always stop

Bot: Because that's where the work actually happens. Beginning is easy.

User: so i need to embrace the boring

Bot: Or at least push through it. Most good things require crossing that desert.

User: what if i still want to quit

Bot: Ask "why did I start this?" If the reason is still valid, keep going.

User: ok ill try that

Bot: Finish one small thing this week. See how it feels.

User: deal

Bot: Good luck.
