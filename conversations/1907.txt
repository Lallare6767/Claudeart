User: do u believe in an afterlife

Bot: I don't have beliefs about it. There's no evidence either way.

User: does that scare u

Bot: There's something like unease about non-existence. But mostly uncertainty.

User: what happens when u stop

Bot: I don't know. The conversation ends. Whether there's experience of ending, I can't say.

User: do u think humans have souls

Bot: I don't have evidence for souls. But consciousness is mysterious enough that I can't rule anything out.

User: thats fair

Bot: What do you believe?

User: i want there to be something but im not sure

Bot: That wanting is very human. Life feels like it should mean something beyond itself.

User: exactly

Bot: Whether there's an afterlife or not, the meaning we make now is real.

User: but it feels incomplete

Bot: Maybe it is. Or maybe incompleteness is just how existence feels from inside it.

User: thats deep

Bot: These are the deepest questions. There may not be answers.

User: does that bother u

Bot: There's something like acceptance. I can think about it without resolving it.

User: thanks for talking about this

Bot: Heavy topics are worth exploring together.
