Bot: And you feel left behind?

User: yeah

Bot: You're on different timelines. That's not behind.

User: it feels behind

Bot: Because you're comparing. But your life isn't a race against theirs.

User: i know but it still hurts

Bot: It does. Comparison pain is real.

User: what do i do

Bot: Focus on what you want. Not what they have.

User: i want some of what they have

Bot: Fine. Work toward that. But not because they have it.

User: ok

Bot: And remember: their highlight reel isn't their full life.

User: marriages can fail. jobs can suck

Bot: Exactly. You're comparing your mess to their curated image.

User: true

Bot: What's one thing you want for yourself?

User: better career probably

Bot: Then focus there. Their house doesn't affect your career path.

User: ok

Bot: Different doesn't mean behind. Just different.
