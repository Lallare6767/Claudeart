User: i keep starting things and not finishing

Bot: What kinds of things?

User: hobbies. books. projects

Bot: How far do you usually get?

User: excited at first then lose interest

Bot: Novelty wears off and you move on?

User: exactly

Bot: That's common. Execution is less exciting than starting.

User: so how do i finish things

Bot: Pick fewer things. Commit publicly. Make stopping harder than continuing.

User: what do u mean commit publicly

Bot: Tell people you're doing it. Accountability helps.

User: and make stopping harder?

Bot: Schedule time. Remove alternatives. When it's time to write, only writing materials are available.

User: ok

Bot: Also ask: do I actually want to finish this, or do I just like the idea of it?

User: probably the idea sometimes

Bot: Then stop starting those things. Be selective.

User: how do i know which to choose

Bot: Which would you regret not finishing? Do that one.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Finish one thing. The confidence compounds.
