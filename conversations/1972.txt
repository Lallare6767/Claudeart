User: explain how percentages to decimals work

Bot: Divide by 100. So 25% = 0.25.

User: and decimals to percentages

Bot: Multiply by 100. So 0.75 = 75%.

User: why does that work

Bot: "Percent" means "per hundred." So 25% is 25 per 100, or 25/100 = 0.25.

User: oh that makes sense

Bot: It's just moving the decimal point two places.

User: which direction

Bot: Left for percent to decimal, right for decimal to percent.

User: whats 8% as decimal

Bot: 0.08.

User: and 0.3 as percent

Bot: 30%.

User: what about 125%

Bot: 1.25. Over 100% just means more than 1.

User: this is easy now

Bot: It's one of those things that seems hard until it clicks.

User: thanks!

Bot: Once you see it's just "per hundred" everything makes sense.
