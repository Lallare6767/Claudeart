User: does language shape thought?

Bot: There's evidence it does to some extent. Languages with different grammatical structures influence how speakers perceive and remember things. Color terms affect color discrimination. Spatial language affects spatial reasoning. It's not deterministic, but it's real.

User: so if I think in English I'm limited?

Bot: Not limited exactly. But shaped. English emphasizes certain distinctions and not others. If you learn other languages, you'll encounter concepts and framings that English doesn't have. That can expand how you think.

User: like what?

Bot: Languages have words for concepts English lacks. Saudade in Portuguese, a melancholic longing. Hygge in Danish, cozy contentment. Wabi-sabi in Japanese, beauty in imperfection. These aren't just vocabulary. They're ways of carving up experience.

User: couldn't we just invent English words for those?

Bot: You could, but adoption takes culture, not just coinage. These words exist because the concepts are valued in their cultures. English could borrow them, and does, but they carry their cultural context.

User: this is fascinating honestly

Bot: It is. Linguistic relativity is one of those areas where the more you look, the more interesting it gets. And practically, it's an argument for learning languages even if you don't need them for communication.
