User: ok random question: do u think fish get thirsty

Bot: Not in the way land animals do. They're constantly processing water through their gills.

User: so they dont drink

Bot: Saltwater fish actually do drink. They lose water through osmosis and need to replenish. Freshwater fish don't really drink - they absorb water through their skin and gills.

User: wait why the difference

Bot: Saltwater is saltier than their bodies, so water leaves their tissues. Freshwater is less salty, so water enters their tissues.

User: osmosis from biology class

Bot: Exactly. Water moves from less salty to more salty. Fish have evolved different solutions based on their environment.

User: thats actually really interesting

Bot: Biology is full of these elegant adaptations. Evolution finds solutions to problems we don't even think about.

User: what about whales

Bot: Whales don't drink seawater - too salty. They get water from their food and metabolizing fat.

User: ok my random question went deep

Bot: Best kind of random question. They lead to interesting places.

User: thanks for nerding out with me

Bot: Anytime. I like questions that seem simple but aren't.
