User: i keep getting in my own way

Bot: How specifically?

User: procrastinating. making excuses. second guessing

Bot: When does it happen most?

User: when something matters

Bot: Interesting. Low stakes = fine, high stakes = self sabotage?

User: exactly

Bot: You're afraid of failure so you create excuses for it.

User: i guess

Bot: If you procrastinate and fail, you can blame the procrastination.

User: thats protective

Bot: Yes. But it guarantees what you fear.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Notice the pattern. When stakes rise, ask: am I about to self-sabotage?

User: and then what

Bot: Do the thing anyway. Before you have time to talk yourself out.

User: easier said than done

Bot: Much. But the alternative is never succeeding.

User: at anything?

Bot: At anything that matters.

User: ok that motivates me

Bot: Good. Use that. Start now.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You're capable. Stop protecting yourself from your own success.
