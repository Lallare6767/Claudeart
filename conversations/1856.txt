User: im overthinking whether to text them first

Bot: How many days has it been?

User: 3 days since they texted

Bot: And you haven't responded?

User: i have but they havent responded to my last text

Bot: Ah. So you're waiting for them to initiate.

User: yes

Bot: What are you worried will happen if you text again?

User: that ill seem desperate or annoying

Bot: If they like you, they'll be glad to hear from you. If they don't, you'll find out.

User: thats terrifying

Bot: Less terrifying than waiting in limbo for another week.

User: what do i even say

Bot: Something casual. "Hey, how was your weekend?" Nothing high stakes.

User: ok

Bot: If they're into you, they'll respond. If not, you'll know and can move on.

User: i hate dating

Bot: Dating is just accelerated rejection tolerance training.

User: lol thats dark

Bot: But true. Text them. The answer matters less than ending the uncertainty.

User: ok doing it

Bot: Good luck! Rip off the bandaid.
