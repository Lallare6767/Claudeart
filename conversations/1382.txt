User: my boss takes credit for my work

Bot: That's infuriating and unfortunately common. How blatant is it?

User: like ill present an idea in a meeting and then hell email it to his boss as his own

Bot: Do you have any paper trail showing it was your idea first?

User: not really. its usually verbal

Bot: Start creating one. Email your ideas to yourself and him before meetings with timestamps. CC relevant people when appropriate.

User: wont that seem weird

Bot: Not if you frame it as "following up on our conversation" or "wanted to document this." It's just being organized.

User: ok thats smart

Bot: Also - some bosses don't realize they're doing it. Have you talked to him directly?

User: no im scared itll backfire

Bot: If you have documentation, the conversation is safer. Without it, it's your word against his.

User: i hate office politics

Bot: Everyone does. But protecting your work isn't politics - it's just good practice.

User: ok ill start documenting

Bot: Good. Make it habit. Your ideas deserve credit.
