Bot: Replaying what you said?

User: what i said. how they reacted. what i should have said

Bot: How long does this last?

User: hours. sometimes days

Bot: Does it change anything?

User: no. just makes me anxious

Bot: So it's purely harmful.

User: yeah

Bot: Your brain thinks it's being helpful. It's not.

User: how do i stop

Bot: First recognize it's happening. Name it. "I'm ruminating."

User: then what

Bot: Redirect attention. Activity. Conversation. Something external.

User: what if i cant stop

Bot: Schedule worry time. "I'll think about this at 5pm for 10 minutes."

User: that works?

Bot: Often yes. Gives brain a designated time so it stops intruding.

User: ok

Bot: Also: others are not analyzing your conversations this closely.

User: really

Bot: They're too busy analyzing their own.

User: hah true

Bot: You said what you said. It's done. Move on.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Be kind to past you. They did their best.
