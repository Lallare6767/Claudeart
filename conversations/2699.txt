User: how do i find the slope of a line

Bot: Rise over run. Change in y divided by change in x.

User: from two points?

Bot: Yes. (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).

User: example

Bot: Points (2, 3) and (6, 11). Slope = (11-3)/(6-2) = 8/4 = 2.

User: what does slope 2 mean

Bot: For every 1 unit right, the line goes up 2 units.

User: what about negative slope

Bot: Line goes down as you move right.

User: and slope 0

Bot: Horizontal line. No rise.

User: undefined slope?

Bot: Vertical line. No run. Can't divide by zero.

User: ok makes sense

Bot: Slope tells you direction and steepness.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice finding slopes from graphs too. Good to see it visually.
