User: i procrastinate by researching

Bot: Researching instead of doing?

User: yeah. ill learn everything about something. then never start

Bot: That's productive procrastination. Feels useful but isn't.

User: why do i do it

Bot: Research is safe. Doing risks failure.

User: so im avoiding failure

Bot: Probably. As long as you're preparing, you can't fail.

User: but i also cant succeed

Bot: Exactly. It's a trap.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Set a deadline for research. Then start regardless of readiness.

User: but what if im not ready

Bot: You'll never be fully ready. Readiness is a myth.

User: that's scary

Bot: Less scary than never starting.

User: ok

Bot: Try: research for one day. Then begin. Learn as you go.

User: learn by doing

Bot: It's how most learning actually happens.

User: but what if i mess up

Bot: You will. That's part of it. Mess up and adjust.

User: ok

Bot: One thing you're over-researching. Start it this week.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Progress beats perfect information. Go do something.
