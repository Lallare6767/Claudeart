User: i think im a people pleaser and i want to stop

Bot: What makes you think you're a people pleaser?

User: i say yes when i want to say no. i apologize constantly. i avoid conflict

Bot: Where do you think that comes from?

User: probably childhood. had to keep the peace

Bot: Makes sense. You learned that your needs matter less than others' comfort.

User: exactly

Bot: Breaking that pattern is hard because it kept you safe once.

User: how do i change it

Bot: Start noticing when you're about to people please. Feel the discomfort of the no you want to say.

User: then what

Bot: Say the no anyway. Or at least a smaller version - "let me think about that."

User: that buys time

Bot: Yes. People pleasers commit immediately. Give yourself permission to pause.

User: what about the constant apologizing

Bot: Catch yourself. Ask "did I actually do something wrong?" If not, don't apologize.

User: that feels rude

Bot: It's not. You're just not used to existing without apologizing for it.

User: this is gonna be hard

Bot: Very. But you deserve to have needs too.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice one small no this week. See what happens.
