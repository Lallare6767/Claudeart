User: what is 3/8 as a decimal

Bot: 0.375

User: how about 5/6

Bot: 0.833... (repeating)

User: and 7/8

Bot: 0.875

User: whats the trick to converting

Bot: Divide numerator by denominator. 3÷8 = 0.375. Or memorize common ones.

User: which should i memorize

Bot: 1/2 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25, 3/4 = 0.75, 1/3 = 0.333..., 2/3 = 0.666..., 1/8 = 0.125

User: ok what about converting the other way. 0.6 to fraction

Bot: 0.6 = 6/10 = 3/5 simplified.

User: and 0.15

Bot: 15/100 = 3/20.

User: 0.333

Bot: That's 1/3. The repeating pattern tells you.

User: how do i know when it repeats

Bot: If the denominator has factors other than 2 and 5, it'll repeat. 1/3, 1/6, 1/7 all repeat. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5 don't.

User: oh thats the pattern

Bot: Yes. 2s and 5s make terminating decimals because our number system is base 10.

User: cool thanks

Bot: Anytime.
