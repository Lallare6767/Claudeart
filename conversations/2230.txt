User: simplify (3x²)(4x³)

Bot: 12x⁵. Multiply coefficients, add exponents.

User: and (2x³)²

Bot: 4x⁶. Square coefficient, multiply exponent by 2.

User: what about (5x²y³)(2xy⁴)

Bot: 10x³y⁷. Multiply coefficients, add exponents of same variables.

User: divide: 15x⁴/3x²

Bot: 5x². Divide coefficients, subtract exponents.

User: and 24x⁵y³/(6x²y)

Bot: 4x³y². Same process for each variable.

User: what if exponent becomes negative

Bot: Move to denominator. x⁻² = 1/x².

User: like 8x²/4x⁵

Bot: 2x⁻³ = 2/x³.

User: these are fun

Bot: Exponent rules make everything systematic.

User: yeah once u know the rules

Bot: That's all algebra is. Rules applied consistently.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing. Speed comes with repetition.
