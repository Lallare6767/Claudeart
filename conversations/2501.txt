User: i feel like a fraud in my own life

Bot: How so?

User: like im pretending to be an adult. to know things. to have it together

Bot: The imposter experience. Very common.

User: even at 35?

Bot: Especially then. More responsibility, more pretending.

User: when does it stop

Bot: When you realize everyone is pretending.

User: really

Bot: Most people feel like they're winging it. Some hide it better.

User: thats kind of comforting

Bot: And kind of unsettling?

User: both

Bot: Welcome to adulthood. We're all making it up.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Stop waiting to feel like you know what you're doing. Act anyway.

User: fake it til i make it

Bot: More like: act first, confidence follows.

User: not the other way around

Bot: Rarely. Action creates confidence. Not vice versa.

User: ok

Bot: You're not a fraud. You're just aware of your uncertainty. Most people aren't.

User: thanks

Bot: Keep going. You're more capable than you feel.
