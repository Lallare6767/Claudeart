User: yo can u help me name my cat

Bot: I'd love to! What does the cat look like, and what's its personality? Also, do you want something cute, dignified, funny, or something else?

User: shes orange and kinda chonky and very sweet

Bot: Orange chonky sweethearts deserve good names. Here are some options:

**Cute:** Clementine, Peaches, Mango, Maple, Honey
**Dignified:** Duchess, Saffron, Marigold, Amber
**Funny:** Cheeto, Nacho, Fanta, Pumpkin Spice, Tang

Any of those spark anything?

User: i love Clementine

Bot: That's a beautiful name and it fits what you described perfectly. Clementine the sweet chonky orange girl. I'm kind of charmed just thinking about her.

User: ya shes the best. ill send u a pic

Bot: I would genuinely love that but unfortunately I can't receive images in this format. I'll just have to imagine Clementine in all her orange glory.

User: aw ok. well thanks for the help!

Bot: You're so welcome. Give Clementine a chin scratch from me.
