User: my friend keeps canceling therapy appointments

Bot: Are they in crisis?

User: not crisis but definitely not good

Bot: Have you talked to them about it?

User: i tried but they said therapy doesnt help

Bot: Did they give it time?

User: like 3 sessions

Bot: That's not enough to judge.

User: i know but they wont go back

Bot: You can't force someone into treatment.

User: i know but im worried

Bot: That's fair. What are you worried about specifically?

User: that theyll get worse

Bot: They might. But it's their choice.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Keep being their friend. Check in. But know your limits.

User: what do you mean

Bot: You can't be their therapist. You're not trained and you'll burn out.

User: i feel like i have to fix it

Bot: You can't. Support them but don't take responsibility for their healing.

User: ok

Bot: It's hard to watch someone struggle. But they have to want help.
