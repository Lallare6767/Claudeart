Bot: Of course they do. Consequences arrived.

User: what do i do

Bot: What do you want to do?

User: part of me wants to respond

Bot: Which part? The lonely part or the self-respecting part?

User: lonely

Bot: The lonely part makes bad decisions.

User: so i shouldnt respond

Bot: I can't tell you that. But ask: has anything changed?

User: probably not

Bot: Then the relationship would be the same.

User: yeah

Bot: Missing someone isn't the same as being right for you.

User: i know

Bot: Protect your peace. That text is about their needs, not yours.

User: ok

Bot: Delete it. Or don't. But don't let loneliness decide.
