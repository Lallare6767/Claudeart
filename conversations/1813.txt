User: i want to be better at conversations

Bot: What do you struggle with specifically?

User: i run out of things to say. awkward silences

Bot: Are you focusing on saying interesting things or on being interested?

User: saying interesting things

Bot: Flip it. Ask questions. Follow up on what they say.

User: like what kind of questions

Bot: Open-ended ones. Not "did you like it?" but "what did you like about it?"

User: oh ok

Bot: Then actually listen. Most people are planning their next thing instead of hearing.

User: i do that

Bot: Stop. Let them finish. Respond to what they said, not what you were planning to say.

User: what if i have nothing to add

Bot: Ask another question. "Tell me more about that" always works.

User: that feels repetitive

Bot: It's not. People love talking about themselves when someone's genuinely interested.

User: i guess i never thought about it that way

Bot: Good conversation is 70% listening, 30% talking. Most people have it backwards.

User: ok ill try this

Bot: Next conversation, set a goal: ask five questions before making five statements.

User: thats concrete. i like that

Bot: Go practice. It gets easier.
