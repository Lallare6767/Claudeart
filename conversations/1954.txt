User: i miss my grandma so much

Bot: I'm sorry. How long has it been?

User: 6 months

Bot: Still fresh. Grief doesn't follow a timeline.

User: everyone acts like i should be over it

Bot: People are uncomfortable with grief. That's their problem, not yours.

User: she raised me

Bot: That's a profound loss. She wasn't just your grandmother.

User: she was my best friend

Bot: Then grieve her as that. Deeply and without apology.

User: i keep wanting to call her

Bot: That impulse might never fully go away. And that's okay.

User: it hurts

Bot: It should. Love and grief are the same thing.

User: i dont want to forget her

Bot: You won't. She's part of who you are now.

User: thanks for letting me talk about her

Bot: She sounds like she was wonderful. I'm glad you had her.
