User: write something about endings

Bot: Every ending carries its own small death -
the last day in the apartment,
the final conversation you don't know is final,
the goodbye that becomes permanent.

We don't always recognize endings
until they've already happened,
and that might be a mercy.
Knowing would make each moment unbearable.

But endings make space.
The door closes, another opens,
and we step through
still carrying what we had.

User: that really resonates

Bot: What ending are you sitting with?

User: leaving my hometown. moving next week

Bot: That's a big transition. Bittersweet?

User: yeah. excited but also grieving

Bot: You're allowed to feel both.

User: its weird to grieve something i chose

Bot: Choosing something doesn't mean there's no loss involved.

User: true

Bot: Take time to say proper goodbyes. It helps with the transition.

User: im trying. its hard

Bot: It's supposed to be. It means the place mattered.

User: thanks for the poem

Bot: Good luck with the move. New beginnings are built on endings.
