User: my therapist said something that upset me

Bot: What did they say?

User: they said i use humor to avoid feelings

Bot: Does that feel true?

User: maybe. but it felt like an attack

Bot: Therapeutic observations often feel like attacks at first.

User: so i should just accept it?

Bot: You should consider it. That doesn't mean they're right - therapists aren't infallible.

User: i do joke a lot

Bot: Humor can be deflection. It can also be coping, connection, or just personality.

User: how do i know which

Bot: When do you use it? Is it when things get deep? Is it to change the subject?

User: maybe when things get too real

Bot: That's worth exploring then. What happens if you don't joke?

User: i dont know. it feels unsafe

Bot: That's the work - figuring out why sincerity feels unsafe.

User: this is a lot

Bot: That's what therapy is for. Bring this feeling back to them next session.

User: ok

Bot: The upset feeling is information. Use it.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck with the work.
