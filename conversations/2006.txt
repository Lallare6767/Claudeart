User: whats derivative of ln(x)

Bot: 1/x.

User: what about ln(2x)

Bot: Still 1/x. Chain rule: derivative of ln is 1/u × derivative of inside. (1/2x) × 2 = 1/x.

User: thats weird

Bot: Makes sense if you think about it. ln(2x) = ln(2) + ln(x). Constant disappears.

User: oh right log rules

Bot: What about ln(x²)?

User: umm... 2/x?

Bot: Exactly! Chain rule: (1/x²) × 2x = 2/x. Or use log rules: ln(x²) = 2ln(x), derivative = 2/x.

User: both ways work

Bot: Always. Log rules can simplify before differentiating.

User: what about ln(sin(x))

Bot: (1/sin(x)) × cos(x) = cos(x)/sin(x) = cot(x).

User: these are satisfying

Bot: Chain rule with natural log is very clean.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing. Ln derivatives come up everywhere in calculus.
