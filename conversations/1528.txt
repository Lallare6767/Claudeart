User: i wanna quit my job but im scared

Bot: What's scaring you?

User: money. stability. what if i dont find something else

Bot: Valid concerns. Do you have savings to cover you while you look?

User: maybe 2-3 months

Bot: That's tight but doable. Can you job search while employed?

User: i should but im so exhausted i cant make myself

Bot: That's the trap. The job drains you so much you can't escape it.

User: exactly

Bot: Can you take any time off to recover and then use that energy to apply?

User: maybe a week

Bot: Use it strategically. Rest first, then dedicate time to applications and interviews.

User: what if i just quit and then look

Bot: Riskier financially but some people need the pressure. Depends on your tolerance for uncertainty.

User: i hate uncertainty

Bot: Then search first. Even doing one application a day is progress.

User: ok. ill try to do that

Bot: You can escape this job. Just needs a plan and incremental effort.

User: thanks. i needed to hear its possible

Bot: It's definitely possible. Lots of people have done exactly this.
