User: whats the formula for velocity

Bot: Velocity = distance divided by time.

User: so miles per hour

Bot: Yes. Or meters per second.

User: example

Bot: Drive 120 miles in 2 hours. Velocity = 60 mph.

User: what about acceleration

Bot: Change in velocity divided by time.

User: example

Bot: Go from 0 to 60 mph in 6 seconds. Acceleration = 10 mph per second.

User: thats how fast im speeding up

Bot: Exactly. Rate of change of speed.

User: whats the formula then

Bot: a = (v2 - v1) / t. Final velocity minus initial velocity over time.

User: what if i know acceleration and want distance

Bot: d = v1*t + 0.5*a*t². Gets more complex.

User: thats calculus territory

Bot: Kind of. Basic kinematics.

User: ill stick with velocity for now

Bot: Good starting point. The rest builds on it.
