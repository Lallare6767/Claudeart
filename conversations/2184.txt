User: how do i know if therapy is working

Bot: How long have you been going?

User: 3 months

Bot: Do you feel understood by your therapist?

User: yeah

Bot: Are you learning things about yourself?

User: some

Bot: Do you feel better after sessions?

User: sometimes worse actually

Bot: That can be normal. Therapy stirs things up.

User: so worse is good

Bot: Not always. But temporary discomfort during growth is normal.

User: how do i know its growth

Bot: Are you seeing patterns you didn't before? Responding differently?

User: a little

Bot: Then it's working. Slowly.

User: i expected faster

Bot: Therapy is slow. Especially for deep stuff.

User: how long til i feel better

Bot: Depends. But three months is still early.

User: ok

Bot: Give it six months. Then reassess.

User: ok

Bot: Trust the process, but also trust yourself. If it's truly not helping, find someone else.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Healing takes time. Be patient with yourself.
