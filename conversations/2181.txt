User: help me understand my anger

Bot: What triggers it?

User: everything lately

Bot: That means it's probably not about the triggers.

User: what do u mean

Bot: Surface anger often covers deeper feelings.

User: like what

Bot: Hurt. Fear. Helplessness.

User: i do feel helpless

Bot: About what?

User: work situation. cant control anything

Bot: So anger is easier than helplessness.

User: i guess

Bot: Anger feels powerful. Helplessness doesn't.

User: yeah

Bot: But the anger isn't solving the helplessness.

User: no

Bot: What would help the actual problem?

User: leaving probably

Bot: Is that possible?

User: eventually

Bot: Then work toward that. The anger is telling you something is wrong.

User: to get out

Bot: Yes. Listen to it, but don't live in it.

User: ok

Bot: Anger is information. Use it, don't obey it.

User: thanks

Bot: Feel it, understand it, then act on the real issue.
