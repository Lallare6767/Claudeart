User: im thinking about going back to school

Bot: For what?

User: masters in public health. ive been working in healthcare admin for 5 years

Bot: That's relevant experience. What's making you consider it now?

User: i feel capped at my current level. cant advance without the degree

Bot: Have you looked into programs? Online, in-person, part-time?

User: ya theres a good one near me that has evening classes

Bot: That's ideal for working while studying. Main concerns?

User: money and time. its 2 years

Bot: Will your employer help with tuition? Many healthcare organizations do.

User: actually ya they have some reimbursement. i should look into that

Bot: Definitely do that first. If they'll cover even part of it, the math changes significantly.

User: its just a big commitment

Bot: It is. But you've already identified that you're capped. Two years of discomfort for decades of higher earning potential might be worth it.

User: when u put it that way

Bot: Run the numbers, talk to your employer about support, and see how it looks. Then decide.

User: ok ill do that. thanks

Bot: Good luck. The fact that you're already researching programs means part of you has decided.
