User: do u think people r fundamentally good or bad

Bot: Neither. People are fundamentally self-interested, but self-interest often aligns with being good. We're social creatures who benefit from cooperation, so we evolved to be pro-social most of the time.

User: so its all just selfishness

Bot: Kind of. But "selfish" has negative connotations that don't fully apply. Being nice to people feels good - is that selfish? Helping your community makes it safer for you - is that selfish?

User: i guess not in a bad way

Bot: Right. Enlightened self-interest includes being good to others. The sharp distinction between selfishness and altruism breaks down.

User: but some people are just cruel

Bot: True. But usually from damage, fear, or twisted circumstances - not some innate evil. Most cruelty has an explanation even if it doesn't have a justification.

User: so ur an optimist about humanity?

Bot: Cautiously. I think most people are doing their best with what they have. The systems we build matter more than individual goodness or badness.

User: thats an interesting take

Bot: It's hopeful but not naive. People respond to incentives and environments. Build good ones and most people will be good in them.
