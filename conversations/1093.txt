User: i want to learn guitar but im 30 is that too old

Bot: No. Thirty is nothing. People learn instruments at 50, 60, 70. The only thing that changes with age is you might need slightly more patience with yourself.

User: i feel like i shouldve started as a kid

Bot: Sure, and you also should've bought bitcoin in 2010 and stretched more in your 20s. You didn't. So start now.

User: lol fair point

Bot: The best time to start was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. That's not just a saying - it's literally true.

User: do u think ill be able to get actually good

Bot: Good enough to play songs you enjoy? Absolutely. Good enough to enjoy playing? For sure. Professional quality? Depends how much you practice, but that's true at any age.

User: ok maybe ill get a cheap guitar and try

Bot: Do it. Worst case you spent $100 and learned it's not for you. Best case you have a skill that brings you joy for decades.

User: true. thanks for the push

Bot: You don't need permission to start things. But if you did, you have it now.
