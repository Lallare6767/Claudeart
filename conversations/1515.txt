User: i have to break up with someone and idk how

Bot: How long have you been together?

User: 8 months

Bot: Are you sure about ending it?

User: ya. i like them but im not in love. its not fair to keep going

Bot: That's a good reason. You're being honest with yourself.

User: but how do i say it without devastating them

Bot: You probably can't. Breakups hurt. But you can be kind and direct.

User: what do i say

Bot: Something like: "I care about you but I don't think we're right for each other long-term. You deserve someone who feels completely certain, and I don't want to keep you from that."

User: in person right

Bot: Yes. Definitely in person. Not text, not call.

User: what if they ask why

Bot: Be honest but kind. You don't have to list everything wrong - "my feelings aren't where they should be" is enough.

User: what if they try to fix it

Bot: Hold firm. If you're sure, don't let them negotiate. It just delays the pain.

User: this sucks

Bot: It does. But staying when you shouldn't hurts both of you more.

User: ok. wish me luck

Bot: Good luck. You're doing the right thing.
