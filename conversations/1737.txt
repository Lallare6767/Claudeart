User: i think im in love with my best friend

Bot: How long have you felt this way?

User: a while. maybe a year

Bot: Does your friend know?

User: no. im terrified to tell them

Bot: What's the worst case scenario if you do?

User: they dont feel the same and it ruins our friendship

Bot: That's a real risk. Do you think you can continue hiding it?

User: its getting harder

Bot: Unrequited feelings don't usually fade on their own when you see someone constantly.

User: so im stuck

Bot: You have three options: tell them and risk it, distance yourself to let feelings fade, or continue as is.

User: none of those are good

Bot: No, they're not. But the current situation isn't sustainable either.

User: do u think i should tell them

Bot: I can't make that call. But I know secrets like this have a way of coming out.

User: what if they do feel the same

Bot: Then you've wasted a year being scared.

User: true

Bot: Whatever you decide, be prepared for multiple outcomes. Hope for the best, plan for the worst.

User: ok. i need to think

Bot: Take your time. But don't think forever.
