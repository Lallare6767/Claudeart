User: how do i meditate

Bot: Basic version: sit quietly, focus on your breath.

User: for how long

Bot: Start with 5 minutes. Increase gradually.

User: what do i do with my thoughts

Bot: Notice them. Let them pass. Return to breath.

User: i cant stop thinking

Bot: That's normal. Meditation isn't stopping thoughts. It's not following them.

User: whats the difference

Bot: Thought appears. You notice it. You let it go. Vs. Thought appears and you spiral for 10 minutes.

User: i always spiral

Bot: Everyone does at first. That's why it's practice.

User: does it actually help

Bot: Studies show reduced stress, better focus, improved mood.

User: how long til i notice

User: thanks

Bot: Five minutes. That's it. Don't overcomplicate it.
