User: almost

Bot: But you didn't. You recovered?

User: how do i get less scared

Bot: Exposure. The only way out is through.

User: any tips

Bot: Practice out loud. Record yourself. Watch without cringing.

User: thats torture

Bot: Effective torture. Also: breathe deeply before you start. Slows your heart.

User: what if i shake

Bot: People notice less than you think. And so what if they do?

User: ill look weak
