User: i feel like im not good at anything

Bot: Compared to who?

User: idk just people in general

Bot: That's not a real comparison. "People in general" includes specialists who've spent their whole lives on one thing. You're comparing yourself to an impossible composite.

User: i guess but even among my friends i feel like the mediocre one

Bot: At what specifically?

User: like everything. theyre all really good at their jobs or hobbies

Bot: You see them at their best. You see yourself at your average. That's not a fair comparison either.

User: maybe

Bot: Also: being decent at lots of things has value. Specialists are fragile - they're useless outside their domain. Generalists are adaptable.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: The "jack of all trades" quote actually ends with "oftentimes better than master of one." People forget that part.

User: wait really?

Bot: Yep. The full phrase is a compliment. Being broadly competent is underrated.

User: huh. that actually makes me feel better

Bot: Good. You're probably better at more things than you give yourself credit for. Pay attention to what you do well instead of what others do better.
