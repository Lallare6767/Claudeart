User: whats the volume of a cone

Bot: (1/3)πr²h.

User: why 1/3

Bot: A cone is one third of a cylinder with the same base and height.

User: really

Bot: Yep! Cylinder is πr²h. Cone fits inside three times.

User: so if r is 3 and h is 6

Bot: Volume = (1/3) × 3.14 × 9 × 6 = (1/3) × 169.56 = 56.52.

User: what about a sphere

Bot: (4/3)πr³.

User: so if r is 3

Bot: Volume = (4/3) × 3.14 × 27 = 113.04.

User: why such weird formulas

Bot: They come from calculus. Slicing shapes and summing infinitely thin pieces.

User: above my paygrade

Bot: For now. The formulas work without knowing why.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Practice with different radii. The numbers get big fast with cubing.
