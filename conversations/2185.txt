User: maybe burnout

Bot: What burned you out?

User: work probably. life

Bot: Have you rested?

User: i try but dont feel better

Bot: Rest alone doesn't cure burnout. You need to address the source.

User: i cant quit my job

Bot: Can you change anything about it?

User: not much

Bot: Then you need extra recovery outside of it.

User: like what

Bot: Things that genuinely restore you. Not just vegging out.

Bot: That's the burnout talking. Try things you used to enjoy.

User: ok

Bot: You don't have to want things right now. You just have to keep going.
