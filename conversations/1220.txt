User: y do i feel so empty

Bot: Empty how? Numb, purposeless, emotionally drained?

User: just like nothing matters and i dont feel anything

Bot: How long have you felt this way?

User: i dont know. maybe months

Bot: That sounds like depression. Have you talked to anyone about it?

User: no i thought it would pass

Bot: Depression often doesn't pass on its own. It needs attention - therapy, sometimes medication. Waiting it out can make it worse.

User: i dont have energy to deal with getting help

Bot: That's the trap. The thing making you exhausted is the thing you need help for. Can you ask someone else to help you find a therapist? Make the first call for you?

User: maybe my sister

Bot: Ask her. Tell her what you told me. You don't have to navigate this alone.

User: i dont want to bother her

Bot: You're not bothering her. You're reaching out because you need help. That's what people who care about you want you to do.

User: ok. ill text her

Bot: Good. That's a real step. The emptiness can get better but you need support.

User: thanks

Bot: Take care of yourself. You deserve to feel better than this.
