User: how long til self driving cars r actually everywhere

Bot: Probably longer than tech companies have been promising. Full autonomy in all conditions is really hard. We might see widespread Level 4 autonomy (works in specific conditions) in 10-15 years, but Level 5 (works everywhere) could be decades.

User: why is it so hard

Bot: Edge cases. A human driver handles weird situations intuitively - construction, unusual road markings, a cop waving you through a red light. Computers struggle with novel situations they weren't trained on.

User: so we're not close?

Bot: Closer than we were, but further than hype suggested. Highway driving is nearly solved. City streets with all their chaos are harder. Full autonomy everywhere is really hard.

User: i was hoping id never have to drive again

Bot: You might not have to within your lifetime, but probably not in the next 5 years. The technology improves gradually then feels sudden when it works.

User: ill take highway driving if i can get it

Bot: That's realistic. Highway autopilot is already available in some cars and works reasonably well. It's the door-to-door autonomy that's far off.

User: ok at least theres something

Bot: Progress is happening. Just slower than the hype cycle suggested.
