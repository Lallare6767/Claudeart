User: how do i know if i need therapy

Bot: Some signs: persistent sadness, anxiety affecting daily life, relationships suffering, feeling stuck, trauma you haven't processed.

User: i have some of those

Bot: Then it's probably worth trying.

User: but i dont know if its bad enough

Bot: You don't have to be in crisis to benefit. Most people go for tune-ups, not emergencies.

User: wont they think my problems are small

Bot: Therapists hear everything from mild stress to severe trauma. Your problems are valid.

User: what do i say in the first session

Bot: They'll guide you. Generally: what brought you here, your history, your goals.

User: goals?

Bot: What you want to change. "Feel less anxious" or "improve relationships" or "understand myself better."

User: i dont have a specific goal

Bot: "I'm not sure what I need, just that I'm not okay" is enough to start.

User: ok maybe ill try it

Bot: You don't have to commit. One session to see if it helps.

User: how do i find one

Bot: Insurance list, Psychology Today, or ask your doctor for referrals.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Good luck. Taking care of your mental health is smart, not weak.
