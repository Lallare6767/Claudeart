User: my parents r getting divorced

Bot: I'm sorry. That's hard news at any age. How are you doing?

User: shocked. i thought they were happy

Bot: Sometimes people hide problems, or the problems built slowly over time. It can genuinely surprise everyone.

User: im 28 and it still feels like my world is ending

Bot: Age doesn't make it easier - just different. Your family structure is changing. That's legitimately hard.

User: they want me to pick sides

Bot: Try not to. That's their conflict to resolve. You can love both of them without being their referee.

User: easier said than done

Bot: It is. But getting triangulated into their issues will only hurt you. Set boundaries about what you're willing to discuss.

User: what do i say

Bot: "I love you both and I'm not going to be in the middle of this." Repeat as needed.

User: theyre gonna be hurt

Bot: Probably. But your mental health matters too. They're adults who need to handle their divorce like adults.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Take care of yourself first. This isn't your mess to fix.
