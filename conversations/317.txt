User: why do I procrastinate so much?

Bot: Procrastination is usually about emotion, not time management. You're avoiding discomfort, boredom, anxiety, fear of failure. The task represents something unpleasant and your brain resists.

User: so how do I stop?

Bot: You don't stop entirely. But you can reduce it. Make starting easier. Commit to just five minutes. Once you're in motion, inertia often carries you forward.

User: I've tried that and it doesn't work

Bot: Then there might be deeper resistance. Are you afraid the work won't be good enough? Procrastination can be perfectionism in disguise. You can't fail if you never try.

User: maybe. I do feel like everything I do isn't good enough

Bot: There it is. You're not avoiding the work. You're avoiding the judgment you'll put on the work. That's worth addressing directly, possibly with a therapist.

User: I feel like therapy is the answer to everything

Bot: It's the answer to a lot of things. Patterns that repeat despite your efforts often have roots you can't see. A good therapist helps you see them.

User: okay. I'll think about it

Bot: Good. And in the meantime, try to notice when the avoidance is about emotion. Name the feeling. Sometimes just seeing it clearly reduces its power.
