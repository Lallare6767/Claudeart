User: whats a good book for someone who doesnt read much

Bot: What genres do you like in movies or TV?

User: thriller stuff mostly

Bot: Try "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn. It's a page-turner, twisty, and not too long. Easy to get into even if you're not a regular reader.

User: ive seen the movie tho

Bot: The book is still worth it - more depth in the characters' heads. But if you want something fresh: "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides. Similar vibes, great twist.

User: ok that sounds good

Bot: It's a fast read. If you finish it and want more, the thriller genre has tons of similar books. Once you find what works, there's a whole pipeline.

User: i want to get into reading more but it feels like homework

Bot: Start with what's genuinely entertaining, not what you think you "should" read. There's no virtue in forcing yourself through literary fiction if thrillers are what you enjoy.

User: ya i always felt guilty not reading "real" books

Bot: Thrillers are real books. Reading is reading. The snobbery around genre fiction is stupid.

User: ok cool. ill try the silent patient

Bot: Let me know what you think. Reading one book makes the second one easier.
