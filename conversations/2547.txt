User: whats the climax of a story

Bot: The turning point. Highest tension. Crisis moment.

User: where in the story

Bot: Usually 3/4 through. After rising action, before falling action.

User: example

Bot: Romeo and Juliet: Romeo kills Tybalt. Everything changes after.

User: thats not the end

Bot: No. Climax isn't ending. It's where outcome becomes inevitable.

User: then falling action

Bot: Consequences unfold. Leading to resolution.

User: can there be multiple climaxes

Bot: Subplots can have their own. Main plot has one main climax.

User: how do i write a good one

Bot: Build to it. Make stakes clear. Force a choice or confrontation.

User: what makes it feel earned

Bot: Everything before leads to it. And it changes things after.

User: not random

Bot: Never random. The opposite. It's where all threads converge.

User: what if its anticlimactic

Bot: That's intentional sometimes. But unsatisfying if unintended.

User: how do i avoid that

Bot: Raise stakes progressively. Climax should be biggest yet.

User: thanks

Bot: Identify climax in stories you read. You'll see the pattern.
