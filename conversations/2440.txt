User: what is the butterfly effect

Bot: Small changes cause large consequences. From chaos theory.

User: like a butterfly causing a tornado

Bot: The idea is: a butterfly flapping wings could start a chain leading to a tornado.

User: is that real

Bot: Metaphorically. Complex systems are sensitive to initial conditions.

User: example

Bot: Miss a traffic light. Meet someone. Marry them. Different life.

User: thats wild

Bot: Most things trace back to tiny moments if you look.

User: does it mean we have no control

Bot: No. It means small actions matter more than we think.

User: so every choice matters

Bot: Potentially. You can't know which ones. So treat them all as important.

User: thats overwhelming

Bot: Or freeing. Even small positive actions could cascade.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: Be kind. Show up. You never know what chain you're starting.

User: ok

Bot: The butterfly effect is usually told as cautionary. But it's also hopeful.

User: small things matter

Bot: Very much. Including this conversation.

User: thanks

Bot: Go flutter your wings. See what happens.
