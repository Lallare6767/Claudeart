User: i feel like im wasting my potential

Bot: Potential for what?

User: i dont know. something more

Bot: More than what you're doing now?

User: yeah

Bot: Based on whose standards?

User: mine i guess. and others

Bot: What would fulfilling your potential look like?

User: i dont know. thats the problem

Bot: So you feel like you're failing at something you haven't defined.

User: when u put it that way

Bot: Potential is a myth. It's always future tense.

User: what do u mean

Bot: You can never reach it because it's always ahead. The goalposts move.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Focus on actual goals. Not abstract potential.

User: like what

Bot: Specific things you want. Skills. Experiences. Achievements.

User: that seems less grand

Bot: But achievable. And that feels better than vague failure.

User: ok

Bot: You're not wasting anything. You're just not measuring right.

User: thanks

Bot: Define what you actually want. Then go get it.
