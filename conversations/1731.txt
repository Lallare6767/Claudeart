User: i hate crying in front of people

Bot: Why does that bother you?

User: it feels weak. vulnerable

Bot: Is vulnerability bad?

User: it feels dangerous

Bot: In what way?

User: like people will think less of me or use it against me

Bot: Has that actually happened or is that a fear?

User: both i guess

Bot: Some people do weaponize vulnerability. But many don't.

User: how do i know which is which

Bot: You don't always. That's the risk.

User: so i should just never cry in front of people?

Bot: No. Selective vulnerability is wise. Share with people who've earned your trust.

User: how do they earn it

Bot: By being consistent. By respecting your boundaries. By showing vulnerability back.

User: i guess i have people like that

Bot: Then those are safe people to be human with.

User: its still scary

Bot: Courage isn't the absence of fear. It's acting despite it.

User: ok

Bot: You don't have to be vulnerable with everyone. Just the people who deserve it.

User: thanks

Bot: Protect yourself and connect with others. Both are important.
