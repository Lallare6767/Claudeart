User: how do i stop being so defensive

Bot: When do you get defensive?

User: when anyone criticizes me basically

Bot: What's the feeling when that happens? Threatened, embarrassed, angry?

User: like im being attacked

Bot: That's worth examining. Criticism isn't usually an attack - it's information. But if you experienced it as attack growing up, your brain learned to respond that way.

User: ya my parents were harsh

Bot: That makes sense. You learned that criticism means danger. Now your brain triggers that response even when you're safe.

User: how do i unlearn that

Bot: Notice when it's happening. Feel the defensive feeling but don't act on it immediately. Take a breath and ask: "Is this person trying to hurt me or help me?"

User: that sounds hard in the moment

Bot: It is. It takes practice. But the pause between the feeling and the reaction is where change happens.

User: what if they are attacking me

Bot: Then defend yourself. But most criticism isn't an attack. And you'll respond better if you assess first rather than react automatically.

User: ok ill try to notice it

Bot: Good. The goal isn't to be a pushover - it's to respond intentionally instead of reactively. You can still disagree; you just do it from a calmer place.
