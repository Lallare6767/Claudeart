User: whats volume

Bot: Amount of space inside a 3D object.

User: how is it different from area

Bot: Area is 2D (surface). Volume is 3D (space inside).

User: formula for a box

Bot: Length × width × height. V = lwh.

User: example

Bot: Box 2 × 3 × 4. V = 24 cubic units.

User: why cubic

Bot: Three dimensions. Length × length × length = cubed.

User: what about cylinder

Bot: V = πr²h. Area of circle times height.

User: sphere?

Bot: V = (4/3)πr³.

User: thats harder to remember

Bot: Yeah. Sphere volume is the tricky one.

User: cone?

Bot: V = (1/3)πr²h. Same as cylinder but third of it.

User: why a third

Bot: Cone fits inside cylinder. Takes up a third of the space.

User: oh thats intuitive

Bot: Geometry has patterns. Look for them.

User: units are always cubed for volume

Bot: Yes. cm³, m³, ft³. Always cubed.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice with actual measurements. Real objects help it stick.
