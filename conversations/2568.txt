Bot: Did you accomplish things at work?

User: yeah i guess. good career now

Bot: That's not nothing.

User: but everyone else has stories and experiences

Bot: Comparison will make you miserable. You made different choices.

User: i regret them

Bot: Regret is easy in hindsight. You did what made sense then.

User: i thought id have time

Bot: You still do. 30s aren't dead.

User: it feels that way

Bot: It's not. People travel and date at every age.

User: i feel so behind

Bot: Behind what? There's no schedule.

User: behind my friends

Bot: Their path isn't yours. You're not racing them.

User: i know but it hurts

Bot: It does. But mourning lost time wastes more time. Start now.
