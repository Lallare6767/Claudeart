User: i need to tell my friend something they dont want to hear

Bot: What is it?

User: their new partner is awful and everyone can see it

Bot: Have they asked for your opinion?

User: no but i feel like i should say something

Bot: This is tricky. Unsolicited criticism of partners often backfires.

User: but im worried about them

Bot: That's fair. What specifically is wrong with the partner?

User: controlling. jealous. isolates them from friends

Bot: That's more serious than just "not a good match." Those are warning signs.

User: exactly. thats why i want to say something

Bot: Then say it once, gently, and make it about observed behavior, not character judgment.

User: what do i say

Bot: "I've noticed [partner] seems uncomfortable when you spend time with us. I'm concerned. I want you to be happy."

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: They probably will. But you've planted the seed. They might remember it later.

User: and if they choose the partner over me

Bot: That's possible. But would you rather watch silently?

User: no

Bot: Then say it and accept you can't control their response.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck. You're being a good friend by trying.
