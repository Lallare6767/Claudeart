User: i need to tell my friend her boyfriend sucks

Bot: Why does he suck?

User: hes controlling and she always cancels plans for him and shes not herself anymore

Bot: That's concerning. Have you talked to her about it before?

User: i tried to hint at it

Bot: Hints won't work for this. She's probably already justifying it to herself. You need to be direct but compassionate.

User: what do i even say

Bot: "I care about you and I'm worried. I've noticed [specific things - canceling plans, seeming different] since you've been with him. Are you okay? Are you happy?"

User: what if she gets defensive

Bot: She might. That's normal. Don't push back hard - just plant the seed. "I'm here if you ever want to talk" and then let it sit.

User: what if she picks him over me

Bot: That happens sometimes. But would you rather stay quiet and watch her sink deeper? At least if you speak up, you've done what a real friend does.

User: ur right. i have to say something

Bot: Be gentle but clear. Focus on her, not attacking him. And be ready to catch her if it falls apart later.
