User: can u give me a word that means feeling happy for someone elses happiness

Bot: Compersion.

User: wait is that a real word

Bot: It's not in traditional dictionaries - it came from the polyamory community. But it describes exactly what you asked.

User: is there an older word

Bot: "Vicarious joy" works but it's two words.

User: interesting that we dont have a common word for it

Bot: English has "schadenfreude" for joy at others' pain but no equivalent for joy at others' joy.

User: thats kind of dark

Bot: It says something about what we historically found notable enough to name.

User: compersion is nice though

Bot: It is. Worth knowing even if it's not mainstream.

User: why did polyamory people invent it

Bot: Because they needed language for feeling happy when a partner is happy with someone else.

User: that makes sense

Bot: Language shapes thought. Having the word makes the feeling easier to recognize and cultivate.

User: i like that idea

Bot: Give compersion a try. Notice when you feel it.

User: i will. thanks

Bot: Enjoy other people's joy.
