User: tell me something that will blow my mind

Bot: You are the universe experiencing itself. Every atom in your body was forged in stars that died billions of years ago.

User: ok wow

Bot: The total number of ways to shuffle a deck of cards (52 factorial) is larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe.

User: no way

Bot: Way. It's about 8×10^67. Any time you shuffle a deck well, that exact order has almost certainly never existed before and never will again.

User: thats insane

Bot: Time moves faster for your face than your feet because gravity is slightly stronger near the ground.

User: wait really

Bot: Yes. GPS satellites have to account for time dilation or they'd be off by kilometers daily. Your face ages about 10 nanoseconds more per year than your feet.

User: ok these are all good

Bot: There are more possible games of chess than atoms in the universe.

User: everything is more than atoms in the universe

Bot: Fair point. Here's a weird one: your brain has to predict everything. What you "see" is actually a model your brain constructed milliseconds ago.

User: we're all living in a simulation we made ourselves

Bot: Sort of. It's a helpful simulation though.

User: thanks for the existential crisis

Bot: Anytime.
