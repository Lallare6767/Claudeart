User: whats the formula for distance

Bot: Distance = rate × time, or d = rt.

User: so if i drive 60 mph for 3 hours

Bot: You travel 180 miles. 60 × 3 = 180.

User: what if i want to find rate

Bot: r = d/t. If you travel 200 miles in 4 hours, you averaged 50 mph.

User: and time?

Bot: t = d/r. 300 miles at 60 mph takes 5 hours.

User: these all come from the same formula

Bot: Yes. Just rearranged. d = rt is the base.

User: whats a harder one

Bot: Two cars leave from the same point going opposite directions at 40 and 60 mph. How long until they're 300 miles apart?

User: um combined speed is 100 mph. so 300/100 = 3 hours

Bot: Perfect! You're getting it.

User: what about same direction

Bot: If they start together going same direction, the faster one gains 20 mph. To be 100 miles apart: 100/20 = 5 hours.

User: oh its the difference in speed

Bot: Exactly. Relative speed matters.

User: thanks for the practice

Bot: Distance, rate, time - universal problem template.

User: got it

Bot: Good luck!
