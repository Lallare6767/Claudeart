User: make me feel better about my messy apartment

Bot: A messy apartment means you're living your life, not curating it.

User: but i feel gross

Bot: That's the clutter affecting your mental state. They're connected.

User: i know i should clean

Bot: Don't should on yourself. Do you want to clean?

User: i want it to be clean. i dont want to clean

Bot: That's honest. Can you afford to hire help?

User: not really

Bot: Then it's you. Can you do 10 minutes?

User: maybe

Bot: 10 minutes with a timer. Just one area. That's it.

User: that feels too small

Bot: Small is how it gets done. Trying to clean everything at once is why it never happens.

User: ok fine 10 minutes

Bot: Good. And if you do more, great. If not, 10 minutes is still better than zero.

User: ur right

Bot: Your home doesn't have to be perfect. Just livable enough that it doesn't stress you.

User: thats a reasonable bar

Bot: Set realistic standards. You'll actually meet them.

User: thanks

Bot: Go set that timer. You've got this.
