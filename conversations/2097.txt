User: im scared to have kids

Bot: Why?

User: what if im a bad parent

Bot: What makes someone a bad parent in your view?

User: neglectful. impatient. passing on trauma

Bot: Are you those things?

User: i try not to be

Bot: That effort is the difference.

User: but what if i mess them up anyway

Bot: You will, a little. Every parent does.

User: thats not reassuring

Bot: Perfect parenting doesn't exist. Good enough does.

User: i dont know if i can handle it

Bot: That's honest. Not everyone needs to have kids.

User: but i want them. i think

Bot: "Think" isn't certainty.

User: no

Bot: What specifically scares you most?

User: losing my freedom. my identity

Bot: Those change. But they don't disappear.

User: you sure?

Bot: Parents still have lives. Just different ones.

User: ok

Bot: The fear means you're taking it seriously. That's good.

User: thanks

Bot: You don't have to decide today. Just think clearly about what you want.
