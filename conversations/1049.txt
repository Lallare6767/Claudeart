User: y do i always fall for the wrong ppl

Bot: What makes them the "wrong" people? What patterns are you noticing?

User: they r emotionally unavailable or just not interested

Bot: Emotionally unavailable people feel safe to someone who fears real intimacy. They can't hurt you in the deepest way because they're never fully there. You get the excitement of longing without the vulnerability of being seen.

Does that resonate at all?

User: damn maybe?? that hit harder than expected

Bot: It's a common pattern. The person who's attainable feels boring because there's no anxiety. Anxiety gets confused with chemistry.

User: so i should date boring ppl?

Bot: No - but you should notice whether "exciting" just means uncertain. Actual compatibility can be exciting too. But it's a different feeling. It's calm and curious instead of anxious and obsessive.

User: how do i change this pattern

Bot: Start by noticing it in real time. When you're drawn to someone, ask: "Am I excited because they're right for me, or because they're keeping me guessing?" That awareness alone can shift things over time.

User: ok ill try. this is lowkey therapy lol

Bot: Therapy would go deeper into where this pattern started. But awareness is the first step. You can't change what you don't see.

User: thanks for real

Bot: Anytime. Good luck out there.
