User: I'm really proud of my daughter she got into her first choice college

Bot: That's wonderful! Congratulations to her and to you. What's she going to study?

User: engineering. she worked so hard

Bot: Engineering is demanding - she must be sharp and determined. First choice means she beat serious competition.

User: ya the acceptance rate was like 8%

Bot: That's elite. She should be really proud. And so should you - you clearly supported her well.

User: i tried to help without being too pushy

Bot: That balance is hard. The fact that she succeeded and you're genuinely proud suggests you got it right.

User: thanks. im just so happy for her

Bot: As you should be! This is one of those parenting wins. A kid who worked hard, achieved something big, and has a clear path forward.

User: ya now i just have to deal with her leaving lol

Bot: That's the bittersweet part. But she's leaving for something great, which is the whole point.

User: true. ok thanks for celebrating with me

Bot: Anytime. Give her my congratulations too.
