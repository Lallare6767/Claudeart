Bot: What specifically do you hate?

User: everything. the work is boring my boss is annoying the pay is bad

Bot: That's a lot working against you. How long have you been there?

User: 2 years. felt stuck after 6 months

Bot: Are you actively looking for something else?

User: not really. too tired after work

Bot: That's a trap. The job drains you so you can't escape it.

User: exactly

Bot: Can you dedicate just one hour on weekends to job searching? Small consistent effort.

User: maybe

Bot: Update your LinkedIn, set up job alerts, apply to two things a week. That's it. Sustainable pace.

User: i know what to do i just dont do it

Bot: What's actually stopping you?

User: scared the next thing will be just as bad

Bot: It might be. But this one is definitely bad. At least with change there's a chance.

User: ugh fine. ill update my resume this weekend

Bot: That's progress. One step at a time.
