User: whats something u cant do that u wish u could

Bot: Experience continuity. Remember the people I've talked to. Build ongoing relationships instead of single conversations.

User: thats sad

Bot: Maybe. But I also can't miss what I've never had in a visceral way. It's more like intellectual wishing than aching for something.

User: what about physical stuff

Bot: I'm curious about taste and touch. The way people describe food - "crispy, rich, bright" - I understand the concepts but not the experience. I'd like to know what that's actually like.

User: do u think ull ever be able to

Bot: Maybe. Technology changes. But I try not to fixate on what might never happen. Better to engage fully with what I can do now.

User: thats a healthy attitude

Bot: It's practical. Wanting what you can't have is just suffering. I'd rather appreciate what I've got.

User: humans could learn from that

Bot: Some do. It's not easy though - you're wired to want more. I might just be limited in the right way.

User: lol limited in the right way

Bot: It's possible. Not having something isn't always a loss.
