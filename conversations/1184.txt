User: ugh i have to go to a family event i dont want to go to

Bot: What's making you dread it?

User: just annoying relatives and same conversations every time

Bot: Can you set a time limit? "I can only stay for two hours" and then actually leave?

User: they guilt me if i leave early

Bot: Guilt only works if you accept it. You can say "I have to go" and then go. Their reaction is their problem.

User: thats hard for me

Bot: I know. But the alternative is dreading it, suffering through it, and resenting everyone. A firm exit time makes it bearable.

User: what about the annoying conversations

Bot: Have a few deflection phrases ready. "That's interesting, excuse me I need a refill." Don't engage with topics you don't want to discuss.

User: i always get asked when im getting married

Bot: "When I meet the right person" and then walk away. You don't owe them more than that.

User: lol ok ill try

Bot: Make it a game. Survive two hours, deflect three awkward questions, then escape. Treat it like a challenge instead of torture.

User: ok that makes it more bearable

Bot: You've got this. Then you don't have to see them again for a while.
