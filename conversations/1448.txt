User: i dont know if i want kids

Bot: That's a big question. What's making it uncertain for you?

User: i like my life as it is. but i worry ill regret not having them

Bot: Both valid concerns. Do you actually want kids or just fear missing out?

User: honestly not sure

Bot: What appeals about having them?

User: the relationship. watching someone grow. family

Bot: And what doesn't appeal?

User: loss of freedom. financial stress. the world feels scary to bring a kid into

Bot: Those are all legitimate considerations. How old are you?

User: 31

Bot: You have time to sit with this. It's not a decision you need to make today.

User: my partner wants kids though

Bot: That's a harder conversation. If you stay uncertain while they're certain, that's a compatibility issue that needs addressing.

User: ya i know

Bot: Talk openly with them. Not to decide right now, but to share where you are. They deserve to know.

User: ur right. thanks

Bot: This is one of those decisions you can't make just to please someone else.
