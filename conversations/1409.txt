User: should i tell my crush i like them

Bot: How well do you know them?

User: we've been friends for about a year

Bot: That's good context. Any signs they might feel the same?

User: i cant tell. theyre nice to me but theyre nice to everyone

Bot: That's the hardest kind to read. What's stopping you from telling them?

User: afraid itll make things weird

Bot: Possibility it will. Also possibility it won't. Unrequited feelings can make things weird too, just silently.

User: so ur saying tell them

Bot: I'm saying staying silent has costs too. The question is which discomfort you prefer - ambiguity or knowing.

User: what if they say no

Bot: Then you know and can move forward. It hurts but then it's done.

User: what if i lose the friendship

Bot: Some friendships survive it, some don't. But pining quietly isn't a friendship either - it's something you're enduring.

User: ugh why is this so hard

Bot: Because you care about the outcome. That's also why it's worth resolving.

User: ok maybe ill tell them this weekend

Bot: Good luck. However it goes, clarity is better than limbo.
