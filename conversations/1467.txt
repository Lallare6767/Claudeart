User: what should i get my partner for our anniversary

Bot: How long have you been together and what's your budget?

User: 3 years. maybe $100-200

Bot: What do they like? Experiences, physical gifts, practical things?

User: experiences usually. they dont care about stuff

Bot: Perfect. Concert tickets, cooking class together, weekend trip to somewhere nearby, nice dinner with the works.

User: cooking class sounds fun actually. we both like food

Bot: Great idea. It's doing something together rather than just giving something. That fits "experiences" well.

User: any specific type

Bot: Pick a cuisine you both want to learn - Italian, sushi, Thai. Or a specific technique like pasta-making or cocktails.

User: we love thai food

Bot: Thai cooking class it is. Make an evening of it - class, then drinks after to talk about it.

User: thats actually perfect

Bot: Add a small thoughtful item if you want - a nice cookbook or spice set to remember it. But the class is the main gift.

User: ok im gonna book it. thanks!

Bot: They'll love it. Three years - that's worth celebrating well.
