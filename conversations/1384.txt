User: how do i tell my friend their partner is bad for them

Bot: This is delicate. What specifically makes them bad for your friend?

User: controlling. like they get mad if my friend hangs out with us

Bot: That's a red flag. How does your friend respond to it?

User: makes excuses for them. says theyre just insecure

Bot: Classic pattern. People in controlling relationships often can't see it clearly.

User: so what do i do

Bot: You can express concern once, specifically. Focus on behaviors, not character. "I've noticed you can't hang out without checking in constantly - is everything okay?"

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: They probably will. Don't push. Just plant the seed and be available. They need to come to the realization themselves.

User: that feels useless

Bot: I know. But pushing often drives people closer to the controlling partner. The best thing you can do is stay present without judgment.

User: what if it gets worse

Bot: Then you repeat your concern, still without ultimatums. People leave when they're ready, not when others tell them to.

User: this is hard

Bot: It is. Watching someone you care about in a bad situation with limited ability to help is painful.
