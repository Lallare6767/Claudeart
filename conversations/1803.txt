User: do u think monogamy is natural

Bot: "Natural" is a tricky word. Humans show both monogamous and non-monogamous patterns across cultures.

User: so neither is more natural

Bot: Right. Both exist naturally in humans. The question is what works for you.

User: i think im monogamous

Bot: Then be monogamous. You don't need evolutionary justification for your preferences.

User: my partner brought up opening the relationship

Bot: How do you feel about that?

User: bad honestly. jealous

Bot: Have you told them that?

User: not yet. i dont want to seem closed-minded

Bot: Being honest about your boundaries isn't closed-minded. It's self-aware.

User: what if we want different things

Bot: That's a compatibility question. Neither is wrong, but mismatched needs create conflict.

User: how do we figure it out

Bot: Talk. Honestly. You can't negotiate needs you don't express.

User: im scared of the conversation

Bot: The conversation is hard. But avoiding it doesn't make the problem go away.

User: youre right

Bot: Tell them how you feel. Let them tell you how they feel. See if there's overlap.

User: ok ill bring it up tonight

Bot: Good luck. Honesty is the only path forward here.
