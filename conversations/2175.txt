User: i feel like a failure

Bot: Why?

User: nothing i do works out

Bot: Like what?

User: jobs. relationships. projects

Bot: What specifically failed?

User: got fired twice. two breakups this year. cant finish anything

Bot: That's a lot. But failure is data, not identity.

User: it feels like identity

Bot: It feels that way when it's cumulative.

User: yeah

Bot: What patterns do you notice?

User: i give up when things get hard

Bot: There. That's actionable.

User: but its not fixable

Bot: It absolutely is. It's a habit, not a character flaw.

User: i dont know how to change it

Bot: Small commitments. Finish something tiny. Build from there.

User: like what

Bot: A book. A short project. Something you can complete in a week.

User: ok

Bot: You're not a failure. You have a quitting pattern. Those are different.

User: ok

Bot: One completion at a time. That's how you rebuild.

User: thanks

Bot: Start today.
