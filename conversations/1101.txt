User: i found out my coworker makes more than me for the same job

Bot: That's frustrating. How much of a difference?

User: like 15k more

Bot: That's significant. Do you know why - experience, tenure, negotiation?

User: we started around the same time. maybe he just negotiated better

Bot: That's usually what it is. So the question is: what do you do with this information?

User: idk im just pissed

Bot: Understandable. But being pissed doesn't get you paid more. You have two options: use this as leverage to ask for a raise, or stew about it indefinitely.

User: can i even bring this up without getting in trouble

Bot: You have the legal right to discuss wages with coworkers - companies can't prohibit that. But tactically, you might not want to reveal your source. Instead, focus on your own value and market rates.

User: how do i ask for a raise without saying i know what he makes

Bot: "I'd like to discuss my compensation. Based on my contributions and research into market rates for this role, I believe I'm underpaid. I'd like to discuss an adjustment."

User: and if they say no

Bot: Ask what it would take to get to the number you want. If they can't give you a path, that's information about whether you should stay.

User: this sucks

Bot: It does. Pay inequity is real and often comes down to who negotiated harder. But now you know, and you can act on it.
