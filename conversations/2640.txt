User: i dont understand ratios

Bot: What part confuses you?

User: like what does 3:2 mean

Bot: For every 3 of one thing, there are 2 of another.

User: example?

Bot: Recipe says flour to sugar is 3:2. If you use 6 cups flour, you use 4 cups sugar.

User: how did you get 4

Bot: 6 is twice 3. So sugar is twice 2 = 4.

User: ok another example

Bot: Class has boys to girls ratio of 2:5. If there are 10 boys, how many girls?

User: umm

Bot: 10 is 5 times 2. So girls is 5 times 5 = 25.

User: oh ok

Bot: Total students would be 35. Ratio to real numbers.

User: what about like 4:6 is that same as 2:3

Bot: Yes. Simplify ratios like fractions. Divide both by common factor.

User: got it

Bot: Ratios are just comparisons. Keep the relationship, scale the numbers.
