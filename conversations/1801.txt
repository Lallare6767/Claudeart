Bot: Anxiety brain often shows up at bedtime when there's nothing else to distract it.

User: how do i turn it off

Bot: You can't force it. But you can redirect it.

User: how

Bot: Body scan meditation. Start at your feet and slowly notice each body part up to your head.

User: does that work

Bot: It gives your brain something to focus on besides the thought loop.

User: what else

Bot: Write down what you're thinking. Get it out of your head onto paper.

User: even the random stuff?

Bot: Especially the random stuff. Externalizing it reduces the loop.

User: ok im gonna try that

Bot: Also - no screens. The light signals your brain to stay awake.

User: im on my phone rn
