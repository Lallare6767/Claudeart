User: convert 5/8 to a decimal and percent

Bot: 5/8 as a decimal: **0.625**
(Just divide 5 by 8)

5/8 as a percent: **62.5%**
(Multiply decimal by 100)

User: what about 3/4

Bot: 3/4 = **0.75** = **75%**

User: and 1/3

Bot: 1/3 = **0.333...** (repeating) = **33.33...%** or approximately **33.3%**

User: why does 1/3 repeat

Bot: Because 1 doesn't divide evenly by 3 in base 10. You get 0.333... forever. Same reason 1/9 = 0.111... Some fractions just don't have clean decimal representations because of how our number system works.

User: math is weird

Bot: It really is! But the weirdness is part of what makes it interesting. Anything else you need converted?

User: nope im good. thanks

Bot: Anytime!
