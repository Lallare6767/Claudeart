User: i feel like im wasting my 20s

Bot: What makes you feel that way?

User: everyones traveling and having adventures and im just working

Bot: Working toward what?

User: saving money i guess. paying off loans

Bot: That's not wasting - that's building a foundation.

User: but ill never get these years back

Bot: True. But you also won't get any years back. That pressure isn't unique to your 20s.

User: i just feel like im missing out

Bot: On what specifically?

User: idk. experiences. memories. fun

Bot: Are you having zero fun or just less than Instagram suggests you should?

User: less than instagram suggests lol

Bot: There it is. You're living a normal life and comparing it to a highlight reel.

User: maybe i need to plan more stuff

Bot: Sure - but also give yourself credit for being responsible. That's not nothing.

User: ur right

Bot: Your 20s aren't a movie. You're allowed to be building something instead of performing adventure.

User: thanks for the perspective

Bot: Your life sounds fine. You're just second-guessing it based on fiction.
