User: if i flip a coin 3 times whats the probability of getting exactly 2 heads

Bot: 3/8 or 37.5%.

User: how do u figure that

Bot: List all possible outcomes: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT. That's 8 outcomes.

Exactly 2 heads: HHT, HTH, THH. That's 3 outcomes.

3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%

User: ok what about at least 2 heads

Bot: At least 2 means 2 or 3 heads.

2 heads: HHT, HTH, THH (3 outcomes)
3 heads: HHH (1 outcome)

Total: 4/8 = 1/2 = 50%

User: this makes more sense when u list them out

Bot: Yeah, for small numbers just enumerate. It's more concrete than formulas. The formula approach (combinations) is the same thing but generalized for when listing gets impractical.

User: when does listing get impractical

Bot: Around 5-6 flips. 2^6 = 64 outcomes. Still doable but tedious. Beyond that, use the formula: C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k).

User: ill stick with listing for now lol

Bot: Smart. Build intuition first, formulas later.
