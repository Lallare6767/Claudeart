User: i feel like im losing my mind

Bot: What's happening?

User: so much stress. work family money all at once

Bot: That's a lot. Are you sleeping?

User: badly. maybe 4-5 hours

Bot: Sleep deprivation makes everything worse. Your brain literally can't handle stress without rest.

User: i know but i cant turn off my brain

Bot: What have you tried?

User: nothing really. just lying there thinking

Bot: A few things help: consistent bedtime, no screens for an hour before, write down your worries so your brain doesn't have to hold them.

User: the worries list might help

Bot: It does for a lot of people. Brain dump before bed - get it out of your head onto paper.

User: ok ill try tonight

Bot: Also - is any of this actually solvable right now or is it just rumination?

User: mostly rumination

Bot: Then your brain is rehearsing problems it can't fix. That's the pattern to break.

User: easier said than done

Bot: True. But awareness helps. When you're ruminating, notice it and redirect.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Take care of yourself. You need rest to handle all this.
