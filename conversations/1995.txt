User: write a limerick about mondays

Bot: There once was a day called Monday / When nobody wanted to fun-day / The alarm clock would scream / We'd wake from our dream / And wish it was already Sunday

User: ha nice

Bot: Limericks are fun. Want another?

User: yeah about coffee

Bot: A person who needed their brew / Found the coffee pot empty, boo-hoo / They searched high and low / But where did it go? / Their coworker drank it all through

User: relatable

Bot: One more?

User: sure

Bot: My cat is a curious beast / Who climbs on my desk for a feast / He knocks over cups / And never gives up / My patience has surely decreased

User: i love these

Bot: AABBA rhythm with the B lines shorter. Try writing one!

User: maybe i will

Bot: Start with a place name. Makes the first rhyme easier.

User: ok thanks!

Bot: Happy writing. Limericks are underrated.
