User: my sibling and i havent spoken in 2 years

Bot: What caused the rift?

User: argument that got out of control. said things we cant take back

Bot: Do you want to reconcile?

User: part of me does. part of me is still angry

Bot: Both are valid. What would reconciliation require from them?

User: an apology. acknowledging what they did

Bot: And would you be willing to apologize for your part?

User: eventually. once they do first

Bot: What if they're waiting for the same thing?

User: then we stay stuck i guess

Bot: Two years is a long time. Is being right worth more than having your sibling back?

User: i dont know

Bot: You don't have to decide now. But someone has to make the first move eventually. Doesn't have to be forgiveness - could just be "I miss you."

User: thats hard

Bot: Everything about this is hard. But it doesn't get easier with more time. It just calcifies.

User: ya ur right

Bot: Think about what you actually want. Then decide if you're willing to be the one who reaches out.

User: ok. thanks for not judging

Bot: Family stuff is complicated. There's no easy answer here.
