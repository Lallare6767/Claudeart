User: do u think im ok

Bot: In what sense?

User: just... as a person

Bot: From our conversation, yes. You seem thoughtful.

User: sometimes i wonder

Bot: Wonder what specifically?

User: if theres something wrong with me

Bot: What makes you wonder that?

User: the way things keep going wrong

Bot: Things going wrong doesn't mean you're wrong.

User: it feels connected

Bot: Correlation isn't causation.

User: thats very logical

Bot: It's also true. Bad luck isn't character flaw.

User: ok

Bot: Are you actually asking if you're okay, or asking for reassurance?

User: both i think

Bot: Then here's both: you seem okay, and wanting reassurance is okay too.

User: thanks

Bot: But real certainty about yourself comes from inside. Not from me.

User: i know

Bot: You're okay. And you'd be okay even if I couldn't confirm it.

User: that helps actually

Bot: Good. Trust yourself. You know yourself better than I do.
