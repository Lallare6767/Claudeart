User: give me a word that describes me based on this convo

Bot: I'd need more conversation to go on, but asking that question suggests self-reflective. You're curious about how you come across.

User: hmm ok. ask me something to learn more

Bot: What's something you've changed your mind about recently?

User: i used to think therapy was for weak people. now im in it and its hard work

Bot: That tells me you're open to growth - willing to revise beliefs when presented with evidence, even when the evidence requires admitting you were wrong.

User: what else u got

Bot: What do you do when you're angry?

User: go quiet. i shut down instead of exploding

Bot: Introverted processing. You turn inward under stress. Probably means you think before you speak, but might struggle to express needs in the moment.

User: thats accurate

Bot: Based on this: self-aware, growth-oriented, introspective. One word? Reflective.

User: i like that

Bot: It fits what you've shown me. Short conversation but clear patterns.

User: thanks for playing

Bot: Anytime. Interesting exercise.
