User: ok give me a challenge

Bot: What kind? Physical, mental, creative?

User: mental. make me think

Bot: Okay. You have 8 balls, all identical except one is slightly heavier. Using a balance scale only twice, how do you find the heavier one?

User: oh this is hard

Bot: Take your time.

User: ok so i cant just weigh them all

Bot: Right. Only two uses of the scale.

User: what if i split them into groups

Bot: Good direction.

User: ok three groups of 3, 3, and 2? wait thats 8

Bot: Keep going.

User: weigh 3 against 3. if theyre equal, its in the 2 i didnt weigh

Bot: And if they're not equal?

User: then its in the heavier 3. then i weigh 1 vs 1 from that 3

Bot: And if those are equal?

User: its the third one! ok so if the first 3v3 is equal i weigh the 2

Bot: Exactly. Two weighings, guaranteed to find it. Nice work.

User: that was satisfying

Bot: Logic puzzles are good for that. Want another?

User: next time. that was enough brain exercise

Bot: Fair. Good job working through it.
