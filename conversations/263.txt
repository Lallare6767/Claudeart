User: my workplace is so toxic

Bot: What's going on?

User: constant backstabbing, people taking credit for others' work, management plays favorites

Bot: That's genuinely bad. Some of that is fixable with documentation and self-advocacy, but if management is the problem, cultural change is unlikely from below. How long have you been there?

User: three years

Bot: Long enough to know it's not a temporary rough patch. Have you seen any improvement or is it getting worse?

User: worse if anything

Bot: Then you need to leave. Toxic workplaces take a toll on mental and physical health. People underestimate how much a bad job affects everything else in their life.

User: but I like my actual work

Bot: You can do your actual work somewhere else, in an environment that doesn't make you miserable. The specific tasks don't require this specific place.

User: I'm worried everywhere is like this

Bot: Some places are toxic, but not all. Look for companies with low turnover, positive Glassdoor reviews about management specifically, and transparent communication. They exist.

User: okay. I'll start looking

Bot: Good. And while you're still there, document everything. Cover your ass, take credit publicly when you can, and emotionally detach as much as possible. You're not there to fix it. You're there until you're not.
