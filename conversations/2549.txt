User: help me with unit conversion

Bot: What are you converting?

User: 5 kilometers to miles

Bot: 1 km ≈ 0.621 miles. 5 × 0.621 = 3.1 miles.

User: and 10 pounds to kilograms

Bot: 1 pound ≈ 0.454 kg. 10 × 0.454 = 4.54 kg.

User: celsius to fahrenheit

Bot: F = C × 9/5 + 32. What temperature?

User: 25°C

Bot: 25 × 1.8 + 32 = 77°F.

User: cups to liters

Bot: 1 cup ≈ 0.237 L. Or roughly 4 cups per liter.

User: how do i remember all these

Bot: Memorize key conversions. Use those to calculate others.

User: which are key

Bot: 1 inch = 2.54 cm. 1 kg = 2.2 lbs. 1 mile = 1.6 km.

User: ok

Bot: Also: metric prefixes. kilo = 1000. centi = 0.01. milli = 0.001.

User: so kilometer is 1000 meters

Bot: Yes. Centimeter is 0.01 meters.

User: logical system

Bot: Very. Metric is easier once you know prefixes.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice common conversions. They come up constantly.
