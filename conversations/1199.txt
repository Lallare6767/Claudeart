User: how do i stop caring what people think

Bot: You probably won't fully stop. But you can care less by noticing that most people aren't thinking about you at all.

User: it feels like they are tho

Bot: That's the spotlight effect. You feel watched because you're watching yourself. Others are too busy thinking about their own lives.

User: so theyre not judging me

Bot: Some might be, briefly. But they're not going home and thinking about you. Their judgments are fleeting and self-focused, not sustained campaigns.

User: but i still feel self conscious

Bot: That's internal, not external. You're judging yourself and projecting it onto others. The fix is changing how you see yourself, not controlling how they see you.

User: how do i do that

Bot: Act how you want to act and accept that some people won't like it. You can't please everyone, so please yourself first.

User: that sounds scary

Bot: It is at first. But living for others' approval is exhausting and impossible. You're trading your authenticity for validation that never comes.

User: ya i do that

Bot: Recognizing it is the first step. Now start making choices based on what you want, not what you think others want. It gets easier with practice.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Good luck. Caring less about opinions takes time but it's worth it.
