User: i got rejected from my dream job

Bot: I'm sorry. How are you feeling?

User: devastated. i really wanted it

Bot: Did they give feedback?

User: no just the standard rejection email

Bot: That makes it harder - no information to learn from.

User: i dont know what i did wrong

Bot: Maybe nothing. Sometimes it's not about you - internal candidate, budget changes, fit issues.

User: but i thought the interviews went well

Bot: They might have. Rejection doesn't mean you did badly.

User: now what

Bot: Grieve it. Then move on. There are other jobs.

User: but it was the dream one

Bot: Dreams adapt. The next opportunity might be something you can't imagine yet.

User: that feels like toxic positivity

Bot: Fair. Let me rephrase: this hurts and it's okay to be sad about it.

User: thanks. i am sad

Bot: Be sad. Then when you're ready, dust off the resume.

User: ok

Bot: You'll find something. This wasn't your only chance at a good career.

User: thanks

Bot: Take care of yourself today.
