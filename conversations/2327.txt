Bot: And you always come up short?

User: yeah

Bot: You're comparing your insides to their outsides.

User: what does that mean

Bot: You see your doubts and struggles. You see their highlights.

User: i know that but it still hurts

Bot: Knowing and feeling are different. The comparison still happens.

User: so how do i stop

Bot: Compare yourself to past you. That's the only fair comparison.

User: im better than i was

Bot: Then you're winning.

User: but others are still ahead

Bot: Ahead on whose timeline? Life isn't a race with one finish line.

User: i guess

Bot: Also: curate your social media. Unfollow what triggers you.

User: that feels like avoiding

Bot: It's protecting your mental health. That's different.

User: ok
