User: why am i so hard on myself

Bot: Good question. Why do you think?

User: i dont know. always been this way

Bot: What does the self-criticism sound like?

User: youre not good enough. you should do better

Bot: Whose voice is that?

User: mine

Bot: Originally though. Who taught you that?

User: my parents maybe

Bot: What did they say?

User: nothing was ever good enough

Bot: So you internalized their voice.

User: i guess

Bot: It's not your voice. It's their script running in your head.

User: how do i stop it

Bot: Notice it. Name it. "That's the internalized critic, not me."

User: and then

Bot: Choose a different response. What would you say to a friend?

User: id be kind

Bot: Be kind to yourself then.

User: sounds cheesy

Bot: But effective. Self-compassion works.

User: ok ill try

Bot: The critic protected you once. You don't need that protection anymore.

User: thanks

Bot: Talk to yourself like someone you love.
