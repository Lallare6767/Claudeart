User: my manager just criticized my work in front of everyone

Bot: That's unprofessional. Public criticism is demoralizing and doesn't improve performance. What did they say?

User: that my report was sloppy and i need to pay more attention

Bot: Was the report actually sloppy?

User: maybe a little but it didnt need to be called out like that

Bot: Even if the feedback was valid, the delivery was wrong. Is this a pattern or a one-time thing?

User: first time but still

Bot: Then I'd address it directly. "I appreciate the feedback on my report, but I'd prefer to receive criticism privately in the future." Sets a boundary without being aggressive.

User: im scared theyll think im sensitive

Bot: You're not being sensitive. You're being reasonable. Public criticism is a management failure, not a you problem.

User: what if they do it again

Bot: Then you have a bad manager and you should start documenting interactions. One time might be a lapse. A pattern is a problem.

User: ok ill say something

Bot: Good. You don't have to tolerate bad management just because they're your boss.

User: thanks. i was questioning myself

Bot: Don't. You're right to be upset. Address it calmly and see how they respond.
