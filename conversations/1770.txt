User: i keep avoiding going to the doctor

Bot: Why are you avoiding it?

User: scared of what theyll find

Bot: What are you worried about specifically?

User: theres a lump that wasnt there before

Bot: How long has it been there?

User: couple months

Bot: I understand the fear. But waiting only makes the unknown worse, and if it is something, earlier is better.

User: i know logically

Bot: Fear isn't logical. But you need to override it here.

User: what if its bad news

Bot: Then you'll deal with it. But you can't deal with what you don't know.

User: the not knowing is almost worse

Bot: It is worse. You're living with fear instead of information.

User: ok. ill make an appointment

Bot: Today?

User: today

Bot: Good. Whatever it is, you're taking control by knowing.

User: thanks for pushing me

Bot: Some things need pushing. This is one of them.

User: ok doing it now

Bot: Proud of you. This takes courage.

User: thanks

Bot: Let me know how it goes if you want. I hope it's nothing.
