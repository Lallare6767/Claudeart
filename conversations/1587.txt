Bot: How does it feel?

User: amazing. like i can actually think

Bot: Physical environment affects mental state more than people realize.

User: ya it was getting bad. took like 4 hours

Bot: Was it that bad or do you have a lot of stuff?

User: both honestly. i need to get rid of things

Bot: Decluttering helps. Less stuff means less to clean and less visual noise.

User: how do i start

Bot: One area at a time. Not everything at once. Start with the easiest - maybe a drawer or a closet.

User: should i marie kondo it

Bot: The "does it spark joy" thing works for some people. Or just: have I used this in a year? If not, probably don't need it.

User: what about sentimental stuff

Bot: Keep some but not all. You don't need every ticket stub. Choose representative items.

User: ok. this is a bigger project

Bot: It is. But now that you cleaned, maintain it first. Declutter gradually.

User: ya dont want to backslide

Bot: 10 minutes a day maintains what hours built. Worth it.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Enjoy your clean space!
