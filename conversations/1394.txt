User: my ex keeps texting me

Bot: What are they saying?

User: checking in. asking how i am. saying they miss me

Bot: How long have you been broken up?

User: 3 months

Bot: And how do you feel when they text?

User: confused. part of me likes it but i know its not good

Bot: Why did you break up?

User: we wanted different things. long term stuff

Bot: Those things usually don't change in 3 months. If the fundamental incompatibility is still there, responding keeps you both stuck.

User: i know but its hard

Bot: Of course it's hard. You probably still have feelings. But responding out of loneliness isn't fair to either of you.

User: should i block them

Bot: If you can't resist responding, maybe. Or at least mute notifications so you're not tempted in the moment.

User: ugh this sucks

Bot: Breakups from otherwise good relationships are the hardest. But if the reasons were real, reconnecting just delays the grief.

User: ur right. ill stop responding

Bot: It's the kindest thing for both of you, even though it doesn't feel like it.
