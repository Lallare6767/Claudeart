User: i think i need to apologize to someone but its been years

Bot: What did you do?

User: i ghosted a close friend during a hard time in my life

Bot: Why did you ghost them?

User: i was depressed and couldnt handle any relationships

Bot: That's understandable. Does understanding it make you feel less guilty?

User: no. they didnt deserve it

Bot: They didn't. But you also deserve compassion for being in crisis.

User: should i reach out after so long

Bot: It depends on what you want from it. Are you apologizing for them or for yourself?

User: both i guess

Bot: Then do it. But don't expect a specific response.

User: what do i say

Bot: "I owe you an apology. I disappeared during a bad time in my life, and I should have at least told you what was happening. I'm sorry."

User: what if they dont respond

Bot: Then you've done what you can. Closure doesn't require their participation.

User: ok. im gonna do it

Bot: Good. The attempt matters, even if the outcome is uncertain.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. This takes courage.
