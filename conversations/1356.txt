User: i finally set a boundary with my family

Bot: That's huge! What was the boundary?

User: i told my mom i cant come to family dinner every week. twice a month is what i can do

Bot: How did she take it?

User: not great. she was upset

Bot: But you held the boundary?

User: ya i explained my reasoning and didnt cave

Bot: That's the hard part. The discomfort of their reaction is the price of the boundary. You paid it.

User: i feel guilty

Bot: That's normal. Guilt is the cost of changing patterns they benefited from. It doesn't mean you did something wrong.

User: will she get over it

Bot: Probably. Most people adjust once they realize the boundary is firm. The initial pushback is testing whether you'll fold.

User: so it'll get easier

Bot: Usually. Consistent boundaries are eventually accepted. It's the inconsistent ones that get fought forever.

User: ok good. im proud of myself

Bot: You should be. This is growth. It's hard to do, especially with family.

User: thanks for the support

Bot: You did the hard thing. That takes courage.
