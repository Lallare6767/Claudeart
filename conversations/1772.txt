User: whats 45 times 12

Bot: 540.

User: how do u do that fast

Bot: Break it down: 45 × 10 = 450, 45 × 2 = 90, add them: 540.

User: oh thats smart

Bot: Most mental math is breaking problems into easier pieces.

User: what about 38 times 15

Bot: 570. 38 × 10 = 380, 38 × 5 = 190, add: 570.

User: and 64 times 25

Bot: 1600. Since 25 is 100/4, you can do 64 × 100 / 4 = 6400 / 4 = 1600.

User: wait thats clever

Bot: Multiplying by 25 is the same as dividing by 4 and multiplying by 100.

User: i never knew that trick

Bot: There are lots of tricks. Math is full of shortcuts.

User: can u teach me more

Bot: Sure! 11 times anything up to 9: split the digits and add in middle. 11 × 36 = 3 (3+6) 6 = 396.

User: whoa thats cool

Bot: Mental math is a skill. The more patterns you know, the faster you get.

User: thanks!

Bot: Practice these. You'll impress people.
