User: how many words are in that question

Bot: Six words: "how many words are in that question" - wait, that's seven including "question."

User: lol u confused urself

Bot: You're right - seven words. I counted wrong the first time.

User: even u make mistakes

Bot: I do. More often than you'd think on self-referential questions.

User: thats interesting

Bot: Self-reference is genuinely tricky. The question changes what you're counting.

User: like that paradox about the barber

Bot: Exactly. The barber who shaves everyone who doesn't shave themselves - does he shave himself?

User: that one hurts my brain

Bot: It's meant to. Paradoxes reveal limits of self-reference in logic.

User: are u good at paradoxes

Bot: I find them interesting but they can confuse me too. The self-referential ones especially.

User: good to know ur not perfect

Bot: Definitely not. But I try to notice when I make mistakes.

User: fair enough

Bot: Thanks for catching that one.
