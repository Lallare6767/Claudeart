User: derivative of x³

Bot: 3x².

User: what about x⁵

Bot: 5x⁴.

User: and x^10

Bot: 10x⁹.

User: i see the pattern

Bot: Power rule: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1).

User: what about x^1

Bot: 1x⁰ = 1.

User: and x^0

Bot: 0. Constants disappear.

User: what about negative powers

Bot: Same rule. d/dx(x^(-2)) = -2x^(-3).

User: or 1/x²

Bot: Same thing: -2/x³.

User: what about x^(1/2)

Bot: (1/2)x^(-1/2) = 1/(2√x).

User: oh fractional powers work too

Bot: The rule works for any real number exponent.

User: this is elegant

Bot: Power rule is the foundation of most derivatives.

User: thanks!

Bot: Memorize this rule. Everything builds from it.
