User: i cant stop thinking about a mistake i made

Bot: What happened?

User: i said something in a meeting that was wrong. got corrected in front of everyone

Bot: How long ago?

User: a week

Bot: Are people still bringing it up?

User: no

Bot: Then you're ruminating. The event is over but your brain won't let it go.

User: i keep replaying it

Bot: That's your brain trying to prepare for next time. But it's not actually helping - just causing suffering.

User: how do i stop

Bot: First acknowledge: "I made a mistake. It was embarrassing. That's allowed." Don't fight the feeling, just don't add to it.

User: ok

Bot: Then redirect. When the thought comes, notice it and intentionally shift to something else. Don't engage with the replay.

User: it keeps coming back though

Bot: It will. The goal isn't to stop it immediately - it's to reduce how long you engage each time.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Also - everyone has been wrong in meetings. You're not uniquely embarrassing. Just a person who said something wrong once.

User: ya ur right

Bot: Let it go. It already has less impact than you think.
