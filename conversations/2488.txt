User: whats a hyperbole

Bot: Extreme exaggeration for effect.

User: example

Bot: "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse." You couldn't actually.

User: more

Bot: "I've told you a million times." "My backpack weighs a ton."

User: so its not lying

Bot: No. No one is deceived. It's understood as emphasis.

User: how is it different from metaphor

Bot: Metaphor compares. Hyperbole exaggerates magnitude.

User: can they overlap

Bot: Yes. "He's a giant" could be hyperbole (he's very tall) or metaphor (he's important).

User: context matters

Bot: Always. Same words can be different devices.

User: when should i use hyperbole

Bot: When you want to emphasize emotional truth over literal truth.

User: like being frustrated

Bot: "If I have to explain this one more time I'll explode."

User: i say that

Bot: Everyone does. Hyperbole is natural to speech.

User: is it okay in writing

Bot: Yes, but use intentionally. Accidental hyperbole weakens prose.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Notice how often you exaggerate. It's probably a lot.
