User: i keep getting back together with my ex

Bot: How many times?

User: this is the fourth

Bot: What keeps pulling you back?

User: when were apart i miss them so much

Bot: And when you're together?

User: it falls apart again for the same reasons

Bot: Then you're missing the relationship, not the person. Or at least not the person they actually are.

User: whats the difference

Bot: You miss the good parts - connection, comfort, familiarity. But those coexist with the reasons it keeps failing.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Stop getting back together. But that requires actually grieving the loss instead of avoiding it by returning.

User: the grief feels impossible

Bot: It does. That's why you keep avoiding it. But the cycle is also painful. You're choosing between two forms of pain.

User: one ends and one doesnt

Bot: Exactly. The breakup pain ends. The cycle pain continues indefinitely.

User: so i have to actually end it

Bot: And then actually grieve. Feel the loss. Don't go back when it hurts.

User: ok. fourth times the last time

Bot: I hope so. You deserve something that actually works.
