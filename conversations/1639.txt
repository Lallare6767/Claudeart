User: rank the best pizza toppings

Bot: That's entirely subjective but here's my take:

1. Pepperoni - classic for a reason
2. Mushrooms - earthy, goes with everything
3. Italian sausage - texture and flavor
4. Fresh basil - brightness and aroma
5. Caramelized onions - sweet and savory

User: no pineapple?

Bot: Didn't make my top 5 but it's not as bad as people pretend. The hate is a meme.

User: thank u. i like pineapple

Bot: Sweet and salty works. Ham and pineapple is a legitimate combination.

User: what about controversial takes

Bot: Anchovies are actually good - just needs a light hand. Also arugula belongs on pizza post-bake.

User: arugula yes. anchovies no

Bot: Fair. They're strong.

User: whats the worst topping

Bot: Canned olives. Rubbery and overpowering. Fresh olives are different but canned ones ruin everything around them.

User: oof harsh

Bot: I have opinions about pizza.

User: clearly. thanks for the fun convo

Bot: Pizza opinions are important. Anytime.
