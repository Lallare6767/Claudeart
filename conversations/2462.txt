User: whats the distance formula

Bot: √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]. Distance between two points.

User: thats pythagorean theorem

Bot: Exactly. The distance is the hypotenuse.

User: example

Bot: Points (1, 2) and (4, 6). Distance = √[(4-1)² + (6-2)²] = √[9 + 16] = √25 = 5.

User: let me try. (0, 0) and (3, 4)

Bot: Go ahead.

User: √[(3-0)² + (4-0)²] = √[9 + 16] = √25 = 5

Bot: Good. That's actually the 3-4-5 triangle.

User: what about (-2, 3) and (4, -1)

Bot: Calculate.

User: √[(4-(-2))² + (-1-3)²] = √[36 + 16] = √52

Bot: Simplify?

User: um. √52 = √(4×13) = 2√13

Bot: Perfect.

User: when is this useful

Bot: Maps. Game design. Any time you need actual distance.

User: not just horizontal or vertical

Bot: Right. Diagonal distance requires this formula.

User: thanks

Bot: Know it well. It's one of the most useful in coordinate geometry.
