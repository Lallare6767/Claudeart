User: im always the one who reaches out

Bot: To friends?

User: yeah. if i dont text first we dont talk

Bot: How long have you tested this?

User: stopped reaching out for a month. silence

Bot: That tells you something.

User: that they dont care

Bot: Or they're passive. Or busy. Or bad at initiating.

User: does it matter why

Bot: Maybe. Some people care but don't initiate. It's not always personal.

User: but i want balance

Bot: That's fair. Have you told them?

User: no

Bot: Consider it. "I feel like I'm always reaching out. Can you initiate sometimes?"

User: what if they dont change

Bot: Then you know where you stand and can decide accordingly.

User: should i drop them

Bot: That's your choice. But first communicate.

User: what if they get offended

Bot: Possible. But friends who can't hear feedback aren't great friends.

User: true

Bot: You deserve reciprocity. Ask for it before giving up.

User: ok

Bot: Some will step up. Some won't. Then you'll know.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Relationships need maintenance from both sides.
