User: is it ok to not want kids

Bot: Yes.

User: people keep telling me ill change my mind

Bot: People love telling others what they'll eventually want. It's condescending.

User: it really is

Bot: Do you know why you don't want them?

User: i just dont. i like my life how it is

Bot: That's a perfectly valid reason.

User: my mom is so disappointed

Bot: That's her to manage, not yours. You don't owe anyone grandchildren.

User: i feel guilty though

Bot: Guilt about not living someone else's life for them? That's not reasonable.

User: when u put it that way

Bot: Your life is yours. Having children you don't want would be bad for everyone, especially the children.

User: thats true

Bot: Some people are meant to be parents. Some aren't. Both are okay.

User: i wish more people understood that

Bot: They will or they won't. Your choice stands regardless.

User: thanks for validating me

Bot: You don't need validation, but I'm glad it helped. Live your life.
