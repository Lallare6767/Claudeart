User: can u explain derivatives to me

Bot: Sure. A derivative measures the rate of change of a function - how fast the output changes as the input changes.

User: like speed?

Bot: Exactly. If position is a function of time, the derivative is velocity - how fast position is changing.

User: ok that makes sense

Bot: The notation is f'(x) or dy/dx. It tells you the slope of the function at any point.

User: how do i calculate it

Bot: For basic polynomials: bring down the exponent, multiply it by the coefficient, reduce the exponent by 1.

User: example?

Bot: f(x) = 3x². Bring down 2, multiply by 3 = 6. Reduce exponent: x¹. So f'(x) = 6x.

User: oh thats not that bad

Bot: It's mechanical for polynomials. More complex functions have their own rules but same concept.

User: what about x³

Bot: f(x) = x³ → f'(x) = 3x². Bring down 3, reduce exponent.

User: i think i get it

Bot: Practice a few more. Power rule is the foundation.

User: thanks!

Bot: Calculus is learnable. You'll get it.
