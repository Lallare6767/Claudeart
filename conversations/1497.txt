User: whats the integral of 2x

Bot: x².

User: how bout 3x²

Bot: x³.

User: wait where did the 3 go

Bot: The power rule: integral of ax^n = (a·x^(n+1))/(n+1). So integral of 3x² = 3x³/3 = x³.

User: oh the 3 cancels with the new coefficient

Bot: Exactly. You add 1 to the exponent and divide by that new exponent.

User: what about integral of x

Bot: x = x¹, so integral = x²/2.

User: and just a constant like 5

Bot: 5x. The integral of a constant is that constant times x.

User: why

Bot: Think of it as 5x⁰. Apply the rule: 5x¹/1 = 5x.

User: ok that makes sense. what about 4x³

Bot: 4x⁴/4 = x⁴.

User: nice. these are easier than i thought

Bot: Basic integration is straightforward. It gets harder with products and compositions, but the fundamentals are just reversing differentiation.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing.
