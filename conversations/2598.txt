User: yeah. we moved when i was 15

Bot: Do you know why you're thinking about it?

User: i drove by it recently. looks so different

Bot: That can bring up a lot.

User: everything was different then. simpler

Bot: Before what?

User: before my parents divorced. before life got hard

Bot: That house represents a before-time for you.

User: exactly

Bot: It's not really about the house.

User: i know. its about what i lost

Bot: And you can't go back.

User: no

Bot: That's one of the hardest parts of growing up. The befores are gone.

User: i hate it

Bot: Makes sense. Grief for your childhood is real grief.

User: i didnt know i could grieve something like that

Bot: You can grieve anything you lost. Even if it's intangible.
