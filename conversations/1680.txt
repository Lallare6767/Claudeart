User: do u think humans are good or bad

Bot: Neither inherently. We're capable of both, and most of us are somewhere in the middle most of the time.

User: but theres so much bad stuff in the world

Bot: There's also enormous amounts of good. You just don't see "person helped neighbor" in the news.

User: thats true

Bot: Humans are complicated. Self-interested but also capable of incredible sacrifice. Cruel but also compassionate.

User: which do u think wins out

Bot: Historically? It's uneven. But we've generally trended toward less violence, more cooperation, better rights.

User: it doesnt feel that way

Bot: Because you see global news instantly. A thousand years ago you'd only know your village's problems.

User: thats perspective

Bot: Our awareness has expanded faster than our ability to process it.

User: so humans are ok?

Bot: Humans are trying. Some succeed, some fail. On balance, I think you're doing better than your worst instincts.

User: thats kinda hopeful

Bot: I think hope is warranted. Just not unconditional optimism.

User: fair enough

Bot: Keep asking hard questions. That's what makes humans better.
