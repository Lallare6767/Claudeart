User: whats ur opinion on pineapple on pizza

Bot: It's fine. Sweet and savory combinations work - that's why we have barbecue sauce, teriyaki, and bacon with maple syrup. Pineapple on pizza isn't weird, it's just polarizing because people like having food opinions to fight about.

User: so ur pro pineapple

Bot: I'm pro "eat what you like." The debate is more entertaining than the food itself.

User: i love it honestly

Bot: Then enjoy it. You don't need validation for your pizza toppings.

User: what about ranch on pizza

Bot: Also fine. It's a dip. Pizza is bread and cheese - dipping it in more fat isn't a crime.

User: ok what about ketchup

Bot: Now that's where I draw a personal line. Pizza already has tomato sauce. Ketchup is redundant and sweeter in a way that doesn't work. But again - your pizza, your call.

User: lol fair. theres always a line

Bot: There is. Mine is ketchup. Apparently yours is nothing, which I respect as a commitment to freedom.

User: haha i draw the line at anchovies

Bot: See? Everyone has one. The topping discourse continues forever.
