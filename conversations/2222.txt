User: explain slope

Bot: How steep a line is. Rise over run.

User: rise over run

Bot: How much it goes up divided by how much it goes right.

User: so 3/2 means

Bot: Go up 3 for every 2 to the right.

User: what if its negative

Bot: Goes down. -3/2 means down 3 for every 2 right.

User: what about 0

Bot: Horizontal line. No rise.

User: and undefined

Bot: Vertical line. Can't divide by zero run.

User: how do i find slope from two points

Bot: (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁).

User: give me an example

Bot: Points (1, 2) and (4, 8). Slope = (8-2)/(4-1) = 6/3 = 2.

User: what does that mean

Bot: For every 1 unit right, the line goes up 2.

User: parallel lines have same slope

Bot: Yes! And perpendicular have negative reciprocal slopes.

User: so if slope is 2

Bot: Perpendicular is -1/2.

User: cool

Bot: Slope connects algebra to geometry. It's fundamental.

User: thanks!

Bot: Practice finding slopes. It'll click.
