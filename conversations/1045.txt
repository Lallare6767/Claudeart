User: i keep comparing myself to my sibling and its making me miserable

Bot: That's a painful trap. What are you comparing specifically?

User: they make more money and seem more successful in general

Bot: Comparison between siblings is especially hard because you share starting points and yet end up in different places. It feels like a direct measure of something. But it's not.

User: it feels like it tho

Bot: Of course it does. But success has a lot of definitions, and income is only one. Are they happier than you? More fulfilled? Do they have better relationships? You're probably comparing their highlight to your whole picture.

User: maybe. i just feel like i should be doing better

Bot: "Should" according to what? Their timeline? Your parents' expectations? Those aren't meaningful benchmarks for your life. What would success feel like for you, not relative to them?

User: idk. i guess doing work i care about and having enough money to not stress

Bot: That's a real definition. Are you on a path toward that?

User: kinda. working on it

Bot: Then you're not failing. You're building your version of success. Your sibling's path isn't available to you and yours isn't available to them. The comparison is an illusion.

User: i know but its hard to stop

Bot: It is. But catch yourself when it happens and redirect to your own goals. Comparison is the thief of joy. You're the only person you need to be better than yesterday.
