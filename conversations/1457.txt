User: solve for x: 2x + 5 = 17

Bot: x = 6.

User: show steps

Bot: 2x + 5 = 17
Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 12
Divide both sides by 2: x = 6

User: ok harder: 3x - 7 = 2x + 4

Bot: x = 11.

Steps:
3x - 7 = 2x + 4
Subtract 2x from both sides: x - 7 = 4
Add 7 to both sides: x = 11

User: nice. one with fractions: x/3 + 2 = 5

Bot: x = 9.

Steps:
x/3 + 2 = 5
Subtract 2: x/3 = 3
Multiply by 3: x = 9

User: ok last one: 2(x + 3) = 16

Bot: x = 5.

Steps:
2(x + 3) = 16
Distribute: 2x + 6 = 16
Subtract 6: 2x = 10
Divide by 2: x = 5

User: these are actually making more sense

Bot: Algebra is just following rules consistently. Same operations both sides, isolate the variable.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing. It becomes automatic.
