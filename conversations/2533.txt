User: i cant accept kindness

Bot: What happens when someone is kind to you?

User: uncomfortable. suspicious. undeserving

Bot: All three?

User: usually one or more

Bot: Where does that come from?

User: i dont know. maybe childhood

Bot: Often does. What was kindness like growing up?

User: transactional. or rare

Bot: So you learned kindness has strings.

User: or that i dont deserve it

Bot: Both are learned. And both can be unlearned.

User: how

Bot: Start by just receiving. Don't deflect. Just say thank you.

User: i always deflect

Bot: I know. That's the pattern. Break it on purpose.

User: ok

Bot: And sit with the discomfort. It will fade with practice.

User: what if they want something

Bot: Some people are just kind. No strings. They exist.

User: hard to believe

Bot: Because you haven't experienced it much. Start looking for evidence.

User: ok

Bot: You deserve kindness. Practice letting it in.

User: ok thanks

Bot: This is deep work. Therapy helps a lot with this pattern.
