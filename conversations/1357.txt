User: what r signs someone likes u

Bot: They initiate contact, remember things you said, find reasons to be around you, ask questions about your life, seem genuinely interested in your answers, laugh at your jokes (even bad ones), and light up when they see you.

User: what about body language

Bot: Mirroring your movements, leaning in when you talk, lots of eye contact, touching their hair or face when talking to you, finding excuses to touch you (arm, shoulder).

User: what if theyre just friendly

Bot: Friendly people are warm to everyone. Someone who likes you treats you differently - more attention, more effort, more interest than they give others.

User: how do i know if im reading it wrong

Bot: You won't know for sure without asking or escalating. But if multiple signs are there and they're specific to you, the probability is high.

User: im scared to make a move

Bot: That's normal. But ambiguity is its own kind of uncomfortable. At some point you have to find out.

User: what do i do

Bot: Express interest casually. "Want to get coffee sometime?" Low stakes, clear enough, easy out if they're not interested.

User: ok maybe ill try

Bot: Good luck. The uncertainty usually feels worse than the answer, whatever it is.
