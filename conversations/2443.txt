User: i feel like a bad person

Bot: Why?

User: i had mean thoughts about someone

Bot: Thoughts or actions?

User: just thoughts

Bot: Thoughts don't make you bad. Actions do.

User: but i wanted something bad to happen to them

Bot: Did you make it happen?

User: no

Bot: Then you felt something. That's human.

User: even wanting bad things for others

Bot: Especially that. We all have unkind thoughts. Control is not having them. It's not acting on them.

User: ok

Bot: Why did you have these thoughts?

User: they hurt me

Bot: So you felt angry. Anger wants retaliation. That's normal.

User: but i should forgive

Bot: Maybe eventually. But you don't have to feel forgiving while hurt.

User: ok

Bot: You're not a bad person. You're a hurt person having hurt-person thoughts.

User: that helps

Bot: Be kind to yourself. And don't act on the thoughts.

User: i wont

Bot: Then you're a good person with normal feelings.
