User: my neighbor lost her husband and shes all alone

Bot: Are they close to you?

User: not really. we wave and chat sometimes

Bot: Are you thinking of reaching out more?

User: i want to but dont want to intrude

Bot: Grieving people often feel isolated. A gesture usually helps.

User: like what

Bot: Food is classic. Or just a card saying you're thinking of her.

User: should i offer to help with anything

Bot: Yes but be specific. "Let me know if you need anything" is hard to respond to.

User: so like what specifically

Bot: "Can I mow your lawn?" or "I'm going to the store, need anything?"

User: ok i can do that

Bot: Small consistent gestures are better than one big thing.

User: what about just talking

Bot: Some people want that. Others don't. Follow her lead.

User: ok

Bot: You're being a good neighbor. Even small kindness matters right now.

User: i hope it helps

Bot: It will. Knowing someone cares always helps.
