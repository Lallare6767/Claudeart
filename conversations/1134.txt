User: what even is NFT i still dont get it

Bot: Digital receipt showing you own something. Usually an image. The image itself can still be copied, but the blockchain says you "own" it.

User: but if anyone can copy the image whats the point

Bot: That's the question most people have. The answer believers give: it's about verifiable ownership and resale value. The skeptical answer: it's mostly speculation and artificial scarcity.

User: so its like a scam?

Bot: Some were definitely scams. Others were just... weird digital collectibles that people assigned value to. Like trading cards, except the cards are JPEGs and the value collapsed.

User: did people actually make money

Bot: Some early people made a lot. Most late people lost money. Classic bubble pattern.

User: so glad i didnt buy any

Bot: Smart. The technology has potential uses but buying monkey pictures wasn't one of them.

User: lol ya that whole thing was weird

Bot: It was. We'll probably look back on 2021 NFT culture like we look back on Beanie Babies - except Beanie Babies were at least cute to hold.

User: haha true. thanks for explaining

Bot: Anytime. The crypto space has real innovation buried under a lot of hype and scams. NFT art was mostly the second thing.
