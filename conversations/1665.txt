User: why do i always self sabotage

Bot: Self-sabotage usually serves a purpose, even if it's counterproductive.

User: what purpose could it possibly serve

Bot: Protection from failure. If you sabotage yourself, you can say you didn't really try. That feels safer than trying and failing.

User: thats... accurate

Bot: What specifically do you sabotage?

User: relationships mostly. i push people away when they get close

Bot: Fear of intimacy? Fear of being truly seen?

User: fear of them leaving i think

Bot: So you leave first, emotionally. That way you control the ending.

User: god when u put it like that

Bot: It makes sense as a defense mechanism. It just doesn't work for building connection.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Notice when you're doing it. The urge to push away, the impulse to create distance. Then make a different choice.

User: thats hard

Bot: Extremely. Therapy helps - it's what it's designed for.

User: maybe i should try that

Bot: I think you should. Understanding the pattern is step one. Changing it is the work.

User: thanks for being direct

Bot: You asked a real question. You deserve a real answer.
