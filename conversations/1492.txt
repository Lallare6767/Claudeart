User: help me write a bio for my dating profile

Bot: Sure. What are you looking for in terms of tone - funny, sincere, casual?

User: casual but with some humor

Bot: Tell me a few things: What do you do for fun? What's something unique about you? What are you looking for?

User: i like hiking, board games, and trying new restaurants. unique: i have a twin. looking for something serious

Bot: Here's a draft: "Twin who got the looks (debatable). Happiest on a trail, at a board game night, or trying a restaurant I found on TikTok. Looking for someone to split appetizers with. Serious inquiries only."

User: oh i like the appetizer line

Bot: It's specific enough to be interesting, signals you want to share experiences.

User: what about the twin part

Bot: Optional. It's a conversation starter but might lead to weird questions. Up to you.

User: maybe ill cut it

Bot: The profile works without it. You can always mention it in conversation.

User: ok. should i add anything else

Bot: Keep it short. Maybe one more line about what you're looking for: "Want someone who can hold a conversation and is up for spontaneous adventures."

User: perfect. thanks!

Bot: Good luck out there. Hope you find your person.
