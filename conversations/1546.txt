User: i have to tell my parents something they wont like

Bot: What is it?

User: that im not going to law school. im doing art instead

Bot: That's a big pivot. Are you sure about the decision?

User: yes. ive thought about it for a year. law would make me miserable

Bot: How do you think they'll react?

User: disappointed. theyve been planning on me being a lawyer since i was little

Bot: Their disappointment is about their expectations, not about you being wrong.

User: i know but it still sucks

Bot: It does. How do you want to tell them?

User: not sure. in person probably

Bot: In person is best for big news. Be direct: "I've decided not to pursue law school. I'm going to focus on art instead. This is the right choice for me."

User: what if they argue

Bot: Listen to their concerns but hold your boundary. You're not asking permission - you're informing them.

User: they might cut me off financially

Bot: Is that a real possibility? If so, have a plan for supporting yourself.

User: ya i have some savings and a part time job

Bot: Then you're prepared. It'll be hard but you're making your choice with your eyes open.

User: thanks for helping me think through it

Bot: You know what's right for you. Trust that.
