User: how do i find x when its in denominator

Bot: Like 5/x = 2?

User: yes

Bot: Cross multiply. 5 = 2x. Then x = 2.5.

User: what about 3/(x+1) = 6

Bot: Cross multiply. 3 = 6(x+1). Then 3 = 6x + 6. So -3 = 6x. x = -0.5.

User: let me check. 3/(-0.5+1) = 3/0.5 = 6. yes!

Bot: Good verification.

User: what if its 2/x + 3/x = 5

Bot: Combine fractions. (2+3)/x = 5. So 5/x = 5. x = 1.

User: and if different denominators

Bot: Find common denominator first.

User: like 1/x + 1/2 = 3

Bot: Common denominator 2x. Then 2/(2x) + x/(2x) = 3. So (2+x)/(2x) = 3.

User: then cross multiply

Bot: 2 + x = 6x. So 2 = 5x. x = 0.4.

User: check: 1/0.4 + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3. yes!

Bot: Perfect. Always check with denominators to avoid extraneous solutions.

User: extraneous?

Bot: Solutions that make denominator zero. Invalid.

User: oh important

Bot: Yes. If you get x = 0 but x is in denominator, discard it.

User: thanks

Bot: These take practice. Do several more.
