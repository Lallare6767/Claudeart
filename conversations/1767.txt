User: i cant focus on anything today

Bot: What's distracting you?

User: i dont know. everything. nothing. brain just wont settle

Bot: Scattered mind or anxious mind?

User: scattered i think. not anxious just... unfocused

Bot: Did you sleep well? Eat? Caffeine?

User: sleep was okay. havent eaten. lots of coffee

Bot: There's your problem. Coffee without food is chaos.

User: i know i should eat

Bot: Your brain needs fuel. Feed it.

User: what if i still cant focus after

Bot: Then try the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes work, 5 minutes break. External structure helps.

User: i should try that

Bot: Also: what are you trying to focus on? Maybe the task itself is the problem.

User: work stuff. its boring

Bot: That's harder. Boring tasks need more structure, not less.

User: ugh

Bot: Eat something. Then do one pomodoro. Just one.

User: ok fine

Bot: After you've done that, reassess. Sometimes starting is the hardest part.

User: youre right. thanks

Bot: Go eat. Your brain will thank you.
