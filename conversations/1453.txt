User: i can't stop crying today

Bot: What's happening?

User: nothing specific just overwhelming sadness

Bot: Has this been building or did it hit suddenly?

User: building i think. but today its like a dam broke

Bot: Sometimes that happens. Emotions accumulate and release all at once. Can you identify what's been building?

User: work stress. loneliness. feeling stuck

Bot: That's a lot. No wonder your body needed to release it.

User: i feel weak for crying

Bot: Crying is a stress response. It's literally your body processing emotion. Nothing weak about it.

User: it doesnt feel productive

Bot: It is though. Emotional release helps you move forward. Suppressing it just delays it.

User: i cant even stop

Bot: Then don't try to stop. Let it happen. When you're done, drink water, wash your face, and see how you feel.

User: ok

Bot: After the crying passes, the stuck feelings will still need addressing. But that can wait until you're more stable.

User: thanks for not telling me to cheer up

Bot: That would be useless. You needed space to feel bad. You have it.
