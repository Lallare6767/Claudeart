User: what are red flags in friendships

Bot: Keeping score, making everything about them, only reaching out when they need something, talking badly about you to others, not being happy when you succeed.

User: what about yellow flags

Bot: Inconsistent communication, frequently canceling plans, being competitive about everything, dismissing your feelings, making jokes at your expense.

User: i think my friend does some of these

Bot: Which ones?

User: not being happy when i succeed and making jokes at my expense

Bot: Those are real problems. A friend who isn't happy for your wins and who puts you down, even "jokingly," isn't much of a friend.

User: maybe theyre just like that

Bot: People can be "just like that" and also be bad friends. Those aren't mutually exclusive.

User: what do i do

Bot: You can address it directly: "When you do X, it hurts." If they don't change or get defensive, you know what you're dealing with.

User: and then what

Bot: Distance yourself. You don't have to formally end it - just invest less. Friendships should make you feel good, not bad.

User: ok. thanks for the clarity

Bot: You deserve friends who genuinely support you. Don't settle for less.
