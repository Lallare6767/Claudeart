User: like what

Bot: "What does success look like in this role in the first 90 days?" Shows you're thinking about performance.

User: ok whats another

Bot: "What's the biggest challenge someone in this position faces?" Shows you want the real picture, not just positives.

User: good one

Bot: "How would you describe the team dynamic?" Helps you understand who you'd work with and if it fits your style.

User: any to avoid

Bot: Don't ask about salary or benefits in first interviews - wait until they want you. Don't ask things easily googled. Don't ask "What do you do here?" about your interviewer.

User: what about asking if i got the job

Bot: Don't ask that. Instead: "What are the next steps in the process?" Same information, more professional framing.

User: this is helpful

Bot: End strong. Your questions show what you care about. Make them count.

User: thanks!

Bot: Good luck with your interview.
