User: im burnt out but i cant take a break

Bot: Why can't you?

User: deadlines. responsibilities. people depending on me

Bot: What happens if you keep going without a break?

User: i crash eventually

Bot: So you'll take a break whether you choose to or not.

User: i guess

Bot: The question is whether it's controlled or forced.

User: i cant just abandon everything

Bot: I'm not suggesting that. But can you reduce? Delegate? Say no to something?

User: maybe

Bot: What's one thing you could drop that wouldn't be catastrophic?

User: theres a volunteer thing i could skip

Bot: There you go. Skip it.

User: but i committed

Bot: And now you're burnt out. Commitments can be renegotiated.

User: i feel guilty

Bot: Guilt is expensive. Burnout is more expensive.

User: ok ill skip it

Bot: Good. And look for other places to create slack.

User: thanks

Bot: Your energy is finite. Protect it or lose it.
