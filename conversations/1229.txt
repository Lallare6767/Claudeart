User: i need to forgive someone but i dont know how

Bot: Who and what did they do?

User: my dad. he wasnt around when i was growing up

Bot: That's a big one. Forgiveness for that isn't quick or simple. What do you mean by "forgive" - let go of anger? Have a relationship? Understand why he did it?

User: i guess let go of anger. its eating at me

Bot: Forgiveness isn't about saying what he did was okay. It's about releasing the hold it has on you. You can forgive and still maintain boundaries.

User: but he doesnt deserve it

Bot: Probably not. But forgiveness isn't for him - it's for you. Carrying anger hurts you more than it hurts him.

User: how do i actually do it

Bot: It's a process. Acknowledge the hurt, understand what you lost, grieve it. Then consciously choose to stop letting it run your life. It's not a one-time decision - you have to keep choosing it.

User: do i have to tell him

Bot: No. Forgiveness can be entirely internal. You can let go without ever talking to him.

User: that makes it less scary

Bot: Good. Start there. Work on releasing the anger for yourself. Any relationship with him is a separate question.

User: ok. thanks. this is hard

Bot: It is. But you recognized you want to let it go. That's the first step.
