User: whats a metaphor

Bot: A comparison that says something IS something else.

User: example

Bot: "Time is money." Time isn't literally money, but we treat it as valuable.

User: how is that different from a simile

Bot: Simile uses "like" or "as." "Time is LIKE money."

User: ok so metaphor is more direct

Bot: Yes. It states identity rather than similarity.

User: can you give me more examples

Bot: "Life is a journey." "The world is a stage." "Her voice was music."

User: those are all common

Bot: The best metaphors are original and specific.

User: like what

Bot: "His anger was a thunderstorm trapped in a glass jar."

User: oh thats vivid

Bot: Good metaphors create images.

User: how do i come up with them

Bot: Think about what two things share. Then connect them unexpectedly.

User: ok ill practice

Bot: Start by replacing "like" in your similes. See how it changes.
