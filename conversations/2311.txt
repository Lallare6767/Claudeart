User: i think my coworker hates me

Bot: Why do you think that?

User: she never talks to me. short replies. no eye contact

Bot: Could be personal. Could be unrelated to you.

User: like what

Bot: She might be overwhelmed. Shy. Going through something.

User: but its only with me

Bot: Have you noticed it with others?

User: not really

Bot: Then it might be about you. Or you might be more attuned to her behavior toward you.

User: what did i do

Bot: Maybe nothing. Sometimes people just don't click.

User: should i talk to her

Bot: You could. "Hey, I feel like there might be tension between us. Is everything okay?"

User: what if she says yes everythings fine

Bot: Then you've opened the door. Her behavior might change.

User: and if it doesnt

Bot: Then be professional and don't take it personally.

User: i want everyone to like me

Bot: That's not realistic or necessary. Neutral is fine for coworkers.

User: ok

Bot: Do your job well. Be cordial. You can't control her feelings.

User: thanks

Bot: Not everyone will like you. That's okay.
