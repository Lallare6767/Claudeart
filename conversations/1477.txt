Bot: How do you feel about close friendships?

User: i love my friends. i just dont feel that romantic pull people talk about

Bot: Aromantic is on a spectrum. Some people feel romantic attraction rarely or never.

User: ya that sounds like me

Bot: How do you feel about it?

User: relieved mostly. like theres a word for it. but also scared people will think im broken

Bot: You're not broken. You just experience attraction differently. There's nothing wrong with that.

User: i havent told anyone yet

Bot: You don't have to until you're ready. But finding community can help - other aromantic people who get it.

User: ok maybe ill look

Bot: Take your time figuring it out. Identity can evolve too. You're valid whatever you conclude.

User: thanks. this helps

Bot: Of course.
