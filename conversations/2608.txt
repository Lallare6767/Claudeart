User: grad school. 6 programs

Bot: When do you hear back?

User: march or april

Bot: That's a long wait. How do you feel about them?

User: i think theyre good but who knows

Bot: You did your best work on them?

User: yeah. revised everything multiple times

Bot: Then you did what you could.

User: but what if none of them accept me

Bot: Then you reassess. Try again or pursue other options.

User: ive wanted this for years

Bot: I know. But wanting something doesn't guarantee getting it.

User: that sounds harsh

Bot: It's realistic. But also you have six chances.

User: yeah

Bot: One yes is all you need.

User: true

Bot: Now you wait. Focus on other things. Refreshing your email won't speed it up.

User: ha okay

Bot: You did the work. Now let it go. What happens next isn't in your control.
