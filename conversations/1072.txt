User: i miss my grandpa so much

Bot: I'm sorry. How long has it been?

User: 3 months

Bot: That's still so fresh. Three months is nothing when it comes to grief. What are you missing most right now?

User: he used to call me every sunday morning

Bot: Oh, that's hard. Those regular rituals leave such specific holes. Sunday mornings must feel empty now.

User: ya i still wake up expecting the call sometimes

Bot: That'll happen for a while. Your brain learned that pattern over years - it doesn't just unlearn it because the calls stopped. It's painful but it's also your mind holding onto him.

User: i never got to say goodbye properly

Bot: Most people don't. We think we have more time than we do. But if he called you every Sunday, he knew you loved him. Goodbyes aren't always spoken.

User: i hope so

Bot: He did. Weekly calls for years isn't obligation - that's wanting to hear your voice. He knew.

User: thanks. this helped
