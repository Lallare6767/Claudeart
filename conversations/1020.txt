User: give me 3 facts about dogs but each fact must be exactly one sentence and start with "Dogs"

Bot: Dogs have a sense of smell that is 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive than humans.

Dogs can understand up to 250 words and gestures, roughly equivalent to a two-year-old child.

Dogs have three eyelids, including one that keeps their eyes moist and protected.
