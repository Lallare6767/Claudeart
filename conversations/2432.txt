User: how do i calculate area of a triangle

Bot: A = ½ × base × height.

User: what if i dont have height

Bot: Use Heron's formula if you have all three sides.

User: whats that

Bot: s = (a+b+c)/2. Then A = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)).

User: thats complicated

Bot: It is. Let's do the simple one first. Base 6, height 4.

User: A = ½ × 6 × 4 = 12

Bot: Units?

User: square units. like 12 cm² if it was cm

Bot: Good. Now where's the height in a triangle?

User: perpendicular from base to opposite vertex

Bot: Exactly. Has to be perpendicular.

User: what about right triangles

Bot: Easy. The two legs are base and height. A = ½ × leg1 × leg2.

User: so 3-4-5 triangle

Bot: A = ½ × 3 × 4 = 6.

User: nice

Bot: Know the half-base-times-height formula cold. It's the most common.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice finding heights in different orientations. That's where people struggle.
