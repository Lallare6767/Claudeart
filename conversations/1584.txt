User: if i flip a coin 10 times and get heads every time, whats the chance of heads on flip 11

Bot: 50%. Each flip is independent.

User: but isnt it unlikely to get 11 heads in a row

Bot: Yes, the whole sequence is unlikely - about 0.05% or 1 in 2048. But the coin doesn't know its history.

User: so the coin has no memory

Bot: Exactly. That's the gambler's fallacy - thinking past results affect future independent events.

User: but in reality id expect it to balance out

Bot: Over thousands of flips, yes. But any individual flip is still 50-50.

User: what about in gambling

Bot: Same math. A roulette wheel doesn't know it landed on black 5 times. Each spin is independent.

User: so systems dont work

Bot: Not for truly random events. You can manage bankroll or make smart bets, but you can't predict random outcomes.

User: what if its not truly random

Bot: Then it's exploitable. Card counting in blackjack works because cards aren't replaced - it's not independent.

User: oh interesting distinction

Bot: Dependence vs independence is key. Once you know which type, you know whether history matters.

User: good lesson. thanks

Bot: Probability is counterintuitive but consistent.
