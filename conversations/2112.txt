User: whats SOH CAH TOA

Bot: Sine = Opposite/Hypotenuse, Cosine = Adjacent/Hypotenuse, Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent.

User: for right triangles

Bot: Yes. It's how you relate sides to angles.

User: so if i have angle and hypotenuse

Bot: Use sin or cos depending on which side you want.

User: example

Bot: Angle is 30°, hypotenuse is 10. Opposite = 10 × sin(30°) = 10 × 0.5 = 5.

User: what about adjacent

Bot: Adjacent = 10 × cos(30°) = 10 × 0.866 = 8.66.

User: and tangent

Bot: If you have opposite and adjacent, tan = opposite/adjacent.

User: so tan(30) = 5/8.66

Bot: Approximately 0.577, yes.

User: how do i remember the ratios

Bot: SOH CAH TOA. Literally just the mnemonic.

User: what if i have sides and want angle

Bot: Inverse functions. sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹.

User: ok this is helpful

Bot: Trig is mostly just this. SOH CAH TOA does most of the work.

User: thanks!

Bot: Practice with different triangles. It becomes automatic.
