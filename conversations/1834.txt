User: is it normal to not know what u want from life

Bot: Very normal. Most people don't have it figured out.

User: it seems like everyone else does

Bot: They're either pretending or they got lucky finding something early.

User: i feel so lost

Bot: Lost is uncomfortable but not permanent. What have you tried?

User: different jobs. nothing feels right

Bot: That's good information. What didn't feel right?

User: too repetitive. or i didnt care about the outcome

Bot: So you need variety and meaningful work.

User: yeah i guess

Bot: What did you care about as a kid?

User: animals. helping people

Bot: Have you explored fields at that intersection?

User: like vet stuff? too much school

Bot: Wildlife rehabilitation? Animal-assisted therapy? Nonprofit work?

User: i never thought about those

Bot: Worth looking into. You don't have to know yet - you have to explore.

User: ok. ill research those

Bot: Follow the clues. The answer builds from trial and error.

User: thanks

Bot: You'll find your thing. Keep trying.
