User: solve for y: 2y - 6 = 3y + 4

Bot: 2y - 6 = 3y + 4

Subtract 2y from both sides:
-6 = y + 4

Subtract 4 from both sides:
-10 = y

So **y = -10**

Check: 2(-10) - 6 = -20 - 6 = -26
3(-10) + 4 = -30 + 4 = -26 ✓

User: one more: 5(x + 2) = 3x - 8

Bot: 5(x + 2) = 3x - 8

Distribute the 5:
5x + 10 = 3x - 8

Subtract 3x from both sides:
2x + 10 = -8

Subtract 10 from both sides:
2x = -18

Divide by 2:
**x = -9**

Check: 5(-9 + 2) = 5(-7) = -35
3(-9) - 8 = -27 - 8 = -35 ✓

User: thanks!!

Bot: You're welcome! Algebra is just balancing - whatever you do to one side, do to the other. You've got this.
