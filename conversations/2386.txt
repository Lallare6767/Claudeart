User: whats 8 factorial

Bot: 8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320.

User: thats huge

Bot: Factorials grow fast.

User: what about 10!

Bot: 3,628,800.

User: and 0!

Bot: 1. By definition.

User: why

Bot: There's one way to arrange zero objects: do nothing.

User: weird but ok

Bot: Math has rules that make other things work. 0! = 1 keeps formulas consistent.

User: when do u use factorials

Bot: Counting arrangements. How many ways to arrange 5 books? 5! = 120.

User: what about combinations

Bot: n choose r = n! / (r! × (n-r)!)

User: thats confusing

Bot: How many ways to choose 3 people from 5? 5!/(3! × 2!) = 10.

User: let me check. 120 / (6 × 2) = 120/12 = 10. yes!

Bot: Good. Factorials are building blocks for probability.

User: this helps

Bot: Practice more. Combinatorics is useful and fun.

User: thanks

Bot: Factorials explode quickly. 20! is already astronomical.
