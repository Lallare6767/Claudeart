User: explain compound interest simply

Bot: Interest on interest. Your money earns money, then that earns money.

User: example

Bot: $100 at 10% annual. Year 1: $110. Year 2: $121. You earned $10 then $11.

User: the $11 comes from

Bot: 10% of $110 instead of $100. Your growth grows.

User: vs simple interest

Bot: Simple interest is always 10% of original. $10 every year.

User: compound is way better

Bot: Over time, massively better. 30 years: compound = $1,745, simple = $400.

User: wow

Bot: That's why starting early matters so much for retirement.

User: whats the formula

Bot: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). P is principal, r is rate, n is compounding frequency, t is time.

User: thats complicated

Bot: For annual: A = P(1 + r)^t. That's simpler.

User: ok

Bot: The key insight: time is the biggest factor. Start now.

User: even with small amounts

Bot: Especially with small amounts. They multiply.

User: thanks!

Bot: Einstein called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world.
