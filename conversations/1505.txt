User: how do i stop procrastinating

Bot: What are you procrastinating on?

User: everything. work projects, chores, personal stuff

Bot: Is it the same feeling for all of them? Or different reasons?

User: different i think. work feels overwhelming. chores feel boring. personal stuff feels scary

Bot: Three different problems then. Overwhelming needs breaking into smaller pieces. Boring needs pairing with something enjoyable. Scary needs examining.

User: what do you mean pairing

Bot: Chores + podcast. Chores + music. Chores + phone call with a friend. Make the boring thing a vehicle for something you like.

User: oh i do that sometimes

Bot: For overwhelming: what's the smallest first step? Not the whole project - just the first five minutes.

User: probably just opening the document

Bot: Do that. Just open it. Momentum often carries you further.

User: and the scary stuff?

Bot: What specifically is scary about it?

User: putting myself out there. what if i fail

Bot: So it's fear of judgment or failure. You're protecting yourself by not trying.

User: ya

Bot: The thing is - not trying is also failing. Just quietly. Is that better?

User: no

Bot: Then try. The outcome is uncertain either way but only one path has a chance.
