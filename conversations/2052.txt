User: explain negative exponents

Bot: x^(-n) = 1/x^n. It's the reciprocal.

User: so 2^(-3) is

Bot: 1/2³ = 1/8.

User: and 5^(-2)

Bot: 1/25.

User: what about fractions

Bot: (1/2)^(-2) = 2² = 4. Flip the fraction, make exponent positive.

User: oh thats cool

Bot: What about x^(-1)?

User: 1/x

Bot: Right. So 3^(-1) = 1/3.

User: and 10^(-3)

Bot: 1/1000 = 0.001.

User: oh its moving the decimal

Bot: For base 10, yes. 10^(-1) = 0.1, 10^(-2) = 0.01, etc.

User: that makes sense

Bot: Negative exponents just mean "divide by this many."

User: instead of multiply

Bot: Exactly. Positive exponents multiply, negative divide.

User: thanks!

Bot: Once you see the pattern, negatives aren't scary.
