Bot: Bookkeeper.

User: wait thats 10 letters

Bot: You're right! Let me reconsider... there's no common 6-letter word with three consecutive double letters.

User: i think the riddle might be broken

Bot: Possibly. Or the answer is something obscure. Do you know the answer?

User: the internet says committee but thats 9 letters

Bot: Another wrong answer floating around. The riddle might be misremembered.

User: thats frustrating

Bot: A lot of riddles get garbled in transmission. Like the "bank" riddle with multiple wrong versions.

User: what riddle is that

Bot: "Where can you deposit money but not withdraw it?" with various incorrect answers.

User: so some riddles are just bad

Bot: Some are. They sound clever but don't actually work.

User: lol at least i know now

Bot: Test riddles before you share them. Save yourself embarrassment.
