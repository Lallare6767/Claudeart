User: i feel like everyone else has it together

Bot: No one has it together.

User: they look like they do

Bot: That's the performance. You're comparing your inside to their outside.

User: but they have jobs and relationships and plans

Bot: So? That doesn't mean they feel together.

User: i guess

Bot: Everyone is improvising. Some just hide it better.

User: even successful people?

Bot: Especially successful people. More stakes, more anxiety.

User: huh

Bot: "Having it together" is a myth. Life is constantly uncertain.

User: that's depressing

Bot: Or freeing. You don't need to achieve something that doesn't exist.

User: so what do i aim for

Bot: Functioning. Growing. Managing. Not "having it together."

User: lower expectations

Bot: Realistic expectations. Meeting them feels better than failing imaginary ones.

User: ok

Bot: Stop comparing yourself to a fiction. Compare yourself to yesterday's you.

User: ok

Bot: You're doing better than you think. Cut yourself some slack.

User: thanks

Bot: No one knows what they're doing. We're all figuring it out.
