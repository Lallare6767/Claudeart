User: i keep having intrusive thoughts

Bot: What kind of thoughts?

User: dark ones. things i would never do

Bot: Are you acting on them?

User: no never. they just pop up

Bot: That's the definition of intrusive. Unwanted, disturbing, unaligned with your values.

User: why do i have them

Bot: Everyone does. Some people notice them more. Anxiety amplifies them.

User: so im not going crazy

Bot: No. In fact, the distress you feel is because they contradict who you are.

User: really

Bot: People who want to do bad things don't feel disturbed by thinking about them.

User: thats reassuring

Bot: The thoughts mean nothing. Your reaction to them is the problem.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Don't engage. Don't try to suppress. Just observe and let pass.

User: like meditation

Bot: Similar. Thoughts are just thoughts. Not actions or intentions.

User: ok

Bot: If they're severe or interfering with function, consider OCD therapy. It helps a lot.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You're not your thoughts. You're the person watching them with concern.
