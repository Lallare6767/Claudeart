User: how do i know if im in love

Bot: What are you feeling?

User: i just think about her all the time and want her to be happy

Bot: How long has this been going on?

User: like 6 months

Bot: Thinking about someone constantly could be infatuation. Wanting their happiness even if it inconveniences you - that's closer to love.

User: what does that mean

Bot: If she got a dream job across the country, would you be happy for her even if it hurt you? That's wanting her happiness above your own. That's a love indicator.

User: ya i think i would

Bot: Then it sounds like love. Not just attraction or excitement, but actually caring about her wellbeing.

User: how do i know if she feels the same

Bot: You don't until you tell her. You can guess from behavior - does she prioritize you, confide in you, want to be around you? But the only way to know is to say it.

User: thats terrifying

Bot: It is. But you can't get the answer without asking the question. If you feel it, eventually you'll need to say it.

User: ok maybe soon

Bot: Good luck. The fear means it matters.
