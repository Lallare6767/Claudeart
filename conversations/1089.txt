User: ugggh i hate mondays

Bot: What's making this one particularly bad?

User: nothing specific just the whole concept of mondays

Bot: Fair. The transition from freedom to obligation is rough. Anything actually happening today or just general monday energy?

User: just vibes honestly

Bot: Those vibes are valid. Mondays are objectively harder - studies show people have more heart attacks on Monday mornings. Your body knows.

User: wait really?

Bot: Yeah, it's a real phenomenon. The stress of restarting work after rest literally affects cardiovascular health.

User: thats dark

Bot: It's an argument for not dismissing "monday dread" as just whining. It's a real physiological response to a real stressor.

User: so what do i do about it

Bot: Some people do something they enjoy Monday morning - good breakfast, workout, podcast they like. Pair the obligation with a reward. Others front-load their hardest task so the rest of the day feels easier.

User: maybe ill try the good breakfast thing

Bot: Worth a shot. Give your monday mornings something to look forward to that isn't work.
