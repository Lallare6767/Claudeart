Bot: What's your relationship like?

User: friendly but not close

Bot: Professional and warm then. Here's a template:

"Hi [Name], wanted to say congratulations on your new opportunity. It's been great working with you—you always brought positive energy to the team. Best of luck in your next chapter. Stay in touch!"

User: thats good. what if we were closer

Bot: More personal. Add specific memories. "I'll miss our coffee runs."

User: and if i didnt like them lol

Bot: Keep it brief. "Best of luck in your future endeavors." Polite and done.

User: should i add my contact info

Bot: Only if you actually want to stay in touch.

User: probably not for this person

Bot: Then skip it. No false offers.

User: thanks this is helpful

Bot: Office goodbyes are a skill. Match warmth to actual relationship.

User: what if they dont say goodbye to me

Bot: Their choice. You took the high road.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Good luck with the message.
