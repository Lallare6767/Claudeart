User: is it weird to have no social media

Bot: Not weird. Increasingly common actually.

User: people look at me strange when i say it

Bot: Their problem, not yours.

User: but i feel disconnected

Bot: From what specifically?

User: what people are doing. events. memes

Bot: Those are real costs. Are they worth the benefits?

User: what benefits

Bot: No comparison trap, less anxiety, more time, better attention span.

User: yeah those are good

Bot: You can still connect. Just differently.

User: how

Bot: Text people directly. Call. Make plans. Real connection.

User: that takes more effort

Bot: Yes. But it's more meaningful.

User: true

Bot: You're not weird. You're just not performing your life.

User: i like that way of putting it

Bot: Live for yourself, not for an audience.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Keep doing your thing. More people will catch on.
