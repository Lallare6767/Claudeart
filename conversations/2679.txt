User: whats a good way to say no politely

Bot: Depends on the situation. What are you declining?

User: a friend asking for money

Bot: That's delicate. Try: "I'm not able to lend money right now. I hope you understand."

User: what if they push

Bot: "I have a personal rule about lending to friends. It protects the friendship."

User: is that true though

Bot: It is for many people. And they can't argue with your rule.

User: what about a work thing

Bot: "I don't have bandwidth for that right now. Maybe [suggest alternative]?"

User: offering alternative helps?

Bot: Yes. Shows you're not just refusing.

User: what about family events

Bot: "I can't make it this time, but I hope it goes well."

User: short and simple

Bot: No over-explaining. That invites negotiation.

User: good point

Bot: "No" is a complete sentence. But polite framing helps relationships.

User: thanks this helps

Bot: Practice saying no. It gets easier.
