User: can we play would you rather

Bot: Sure. You go first or me?

User: you start

Bot: Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible?

User: fly. invisibility seems lonely

Bot: Interesting. Most people choose invisible.

User: ur turn to answer. live without music or without movies

Bot: Without movies. Music is more integrated into daily life.

User: agree. ok would u rather know how u die or when u die

Bot: When. Knowing how would make me avoid everything.

User: good point. never be able to lie or never trust anyone

Bot: Never lie. Being unable to trust sounds miserable.

User: same. would u rather be famous but miserable or unknown but happy

Bot: Unknown and happy. Fame seems like a trap.

User: definitely. one more. always be 10 minutes late or 20 minutes early

Bot: 20 minutes early. Being late is disrespectful.

User: thats a strong answer

Bot: Time affects others. I take it seriously.

User: fair. this was fun

Bot: It reveals how people think. Good game.

User: thanks

Bot: Anytime. Would you rather never play again or... just kidding.
