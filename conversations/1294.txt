User: whats a good way to start meditating

Bot: Start stupid simple. Sit quietly for 2 minutes and focus on your breath. When your mind wanders (it will), notice it and come back to the breath. That's it.

User: 2 minutes seems too short

Bot: It's not. Most people can't do 2 minutes well at first. Start there and build up.

User: do i need an app

Bot: Apps help some people. Headspace and Calm are popular. But you don't need anything - just a timer.

User: what about guided vs silent

Bot: Start guided - it gives your mind something to anchor to. Move to silent once you have the basics down.

User: how long until i see benefits

Bot: People often notice reduced stress and better focus within a couple weeks of daily practice. But it varies.

User: daily seems like a lot

Bot: 2 minutes daily is 14 minutes a week. That's nothing. The consistency matters more than the duration.

User: ok fine ill try 2 minutes

Bot: Good. Same time every day, ideally. Habit stacks well - do it right after something you already do.

User: like after coffee

Bot: Perfect. Coffee then meditation. In two weeks you'll be doing it automatically.
