User: i dont know who i am anymore

Bot: That's disorienting. What happened?

User: nothing specific just feel lost

Bot: Have you changed recently? Or has everything else changed?

User: i think i outgrew my old self

Bot: That's growth, not loss. But it's still uncomfortable.

User: yeah feels like a stranger in my own life

Bot: What parts feel wrong now?

User: my job my friends my hobbies

Bot: All of it?

User: yeah none of it fits

Bot: Then you're in transition. Old skin shed, new one not grown yet.

User: how long does it last

Bot: Varies. Could be months.

User: what do i do

User: this is scary

Bot: Yes. But staying in the wrong life forever is scarier.

User: true. thanks
