User: damn thats 46 right

Bot: 46 presidencies but 45 different people - Cleveland served twice, non-consecutively.

User: who was the shortest serving

Bot: William Henry Harrison - 31 days. Caught pneumonia during his inauguration speech.

User: wait what

Bot: His speech was almost 2 hours long in cold rain. He developed pneumonia and died a month later. Shortest presidency ever.

User: thats crazy. who was longest

Bot: FDR - Franklin Roosevelt. Four terms, about 12 years total. That's why we have term limits now.

User: oh thats why

Bot: Yep. After him they passed the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms.

User: cool history lesson thanks

Bot: Anytime. Presidential trivia is surprisingly interesting once you get into it.
