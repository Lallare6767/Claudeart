Bot: Understanding and agreement are different.

User: i want both

Bot: That's harder to find.

User: is it unrealistic

Bot: Not unrealistic. Just rare. One or two people is normal.

User: feels lonely

Bot: It can. But one deep connection is better than many shallow.

User: my sister gets me

Bot: That's valuable. Nurture that.

User: i should

Bot: Also: are you explaining yourself well? We often expect mind-reading.

User: maybe not

Bot: Be explicit. "This is important to me because..." Give people a chance.

User: ok

Bot: You can be understood. Just not by everyone. And that's okay.
