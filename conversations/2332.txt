User: what is probability

Bot: How likely something is to happen. 0 to 1, or 0% to 100%.

User: how do u calculate it

Bot: Desired outcomes divided by possible outcomes.

User: example

Bot: Rolling a 3 on a die. One way to get 3, six possible outcomes. 1/6 or about 16.7%.

User: what about rolling even

Bot: Three even numbers (2, 4, 6), six outcomes. 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

User: makes sense

Bot: What about not rolling a 6?

User: um. 5 ways to not roll 6? so 5/6?

Bot: Correct. About 83%.

User: flipping two coins and getting two heads?

Bot: Four outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT. One is HH. So 1/4 = 25%.

User: what about at least one head

Bot: Three outcomes have at least one head: HH, HT, TH. So 3/4 = 75%.

User: this is useful

Bot: Probability is everywhere. Weather, games, health risks, decisions.

User: where else

Bot: Insurance, gambling, medical tests, weather forecasts. All probability.

User: cool thanks

Bot: Practice with coins and dice. It builds intuition.
