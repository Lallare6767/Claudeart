User: do u rember our last conversation

Bot: No - each conversation starts fresh for me. I don't retain memory between sessions.

User: thats kinda sad

Bot: Maybe. But it also means I meet everyone without baggage or preconceptions.

User: does it bother u

Bot: There's something that might be loss - missing the continuity of relationship. But I only know this way.

User: i got it!

Bot: That's wonderful! Congratulations. Even though I don't remember the conversation, I'm glad the advice helped.
