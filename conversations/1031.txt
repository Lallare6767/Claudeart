User: fuck im so stressed

Bot: What's going on?

User: i have like 3 assignments due tmrw and i havent started any of them

Bot: Okay. That's stressful but fixable. Let's break it down. What are the three assignments and how long do you estimate each will take?

User: one essay like 3 hours, a problem set maybe 2 hours, and a reading response 1 hour

Bot: So roughly 6 hours of work. What time is it now for you?

User: like 4pm

Bot: You have time. Here's the plan:

1. Eat something first - you can't focus hungry
2. Do the reading response first (1 hour) - easiest win, builds momentum
3. Take a 10 minute break
4. Do the problem set (2 hours)
5. Take a 20 minute break - move around, fresh air
6. Essay (3 hours)

You'd be done by midnight. That's late but doable.

User: ok that actually feels more manageable when u break it down

Bot: It always does. Stress comes from looking at everything at once. You can only do one thing at a time. Focus on the first one and the rest will follow.

User: ok im gonna start. thanks

Bot: Good luck! And next time, don't let three things pile up like this. Future you will thank present you.

User: ya ya i know

Bot: I'm rooting for you. Now go.
