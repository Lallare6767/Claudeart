User: what is personification

Bot: Giving human traits to non-human things.

User: example

Bot: "The wind whispered through the trees." Wind doesn't actually whisper.

User: oh i use that without thinking

Bot: Most people do. It's very common in language.

User: more examples

Bot: "Time flies." "The sun smiled down." "The city never sleeps."

User: those are clichés

Bot: Many personifications become clichés through overuse.

User: how do i make original ones

Bot: Give unexpected human traits. "The phone sulked in my pocket."

User: that's good

Bot: It implies the phone feels neglected. Creates character.

User: "the coffee sighed in its mug"

Bot: Nice. Suggests it's tired of waiting.

User: this is fun

Bot: Personification makes writing vivid. Objects feel alive.

User: when is it too much

Bot: When every sentence has it. Use sparingly for impact.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Notice it in what you read. It's everywhere.
