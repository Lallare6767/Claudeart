User: i moved and i miss home

Bot: How long ago?

User: three months

Bot: Still adjusting. That's normal.

User: but i wanted to move

Bot: You can want something and still grieve what you left.

User: both feelings at once

Bot: Always. Decisions have costs and benefits.

User: i miss my friends. the familiar places

Bot: Of course. You had years of memories there.

User: will it get better

Bot: Yes. But you have to build a life where you are now.

User: how

Bot: Say yes to things. Meet people. Explore. Create new memories.

User: i havent been

Bot: That extends the adjustment. Isolation keeps you stuck.

User: ok

Bot: And visit home when you can. But don't live in limbo.

User: limbo?

Bot: Neither fully here nor there. Commit to where you are.

User: ok

Bot: Home will always exist. But you live here now. Build roots.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Three months is early. Give it a year. Then decide.
