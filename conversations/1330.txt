User: i hate conflict but i need to stand up for myself

Bot: What's the situation?

User: my coworker keeps taking credit for my work

Bot: That's frustrating and worth addressing. When you say you hate conflict, what do you mean - you avoid it, or it just feels bad?

User: i avoid it and then feel resentful

Bot: That's the trap. Avoiding conflict doesn't prevent bad feelings - it just shifts them from confrontation to resentment. You're suffering either way.

User: so just do it even though it sucks

Bot: Yes. But pick your approach carefully. You don't have to be aggressive. Firm and factual works.

User: what do i say

Bot: In the moment: "Actually, I developed that idea last week - let me walk everyone through it." After the fact: "When you presented my work, I felt overlooked. I need you to credit me going forward."

User: what if they deny it

Bot: You document. Emails, timestamps, witnesses. If it becomes a pattern, escalate to your manager.

User: ugh this is stressful

Bot: Less stressful than letting someone steal your credit indefinitely. Stand up once and they usually stop.

User: ok ill say something next time

Bot: Good. You deserve credit for your work. Don't let someone else take it.
