User: im scared to start therapy

Bot: What specifically scares you about it?

User: talking about my feelings to a stranger

Bot: That's a common fear. What makes that feel scary?

User: being judged. or crying in front of someone

Bot: Therapists are trained not to judge. And they see people cry constantly - it's part of the job.

User: what if i dont know what to say

Bot: The therapist guides the conversation. You don't have to have it all figured out.

User: what if it doesnt help

Bot: Then you try a different therapist. Not every match works.

User: how do i find a good one

Bot: Psychology Today's directory lets you filter by specialty, location, and insurance. Read their profiles.

User: ur right. im gonna look into it

Bot: Good. Taking care of your mental health is brave, not weak.

User: thanks

Bot: You've got this. The hardest part is starting.
