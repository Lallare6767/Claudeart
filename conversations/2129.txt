User: what is the law of cosines

Bot: c² = a² + b² - 2ab×cos(C). Used for any triangle, not just right ones.

User: when do i use it

Bot: When you have two sides and the included angle. Or all three sides.

User: its like pythagorean but for all triangles

Bot: Exactly! When C = 90°, cos(90°) = 0, so it reduces to a² + b² = c².

User: oh cool

Bot: Give me an example to solve.

User: sides 5 and 7 angle between them 60 degrees

Bot: c² = 25 + 49 - 2(5)(7)cos(60°) = 74 - 70(0.5) = 74 - 35 = 39.

User: so c = √39

Bot: About 6.24.

User: what about law of sines

Bot: a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C). Different use case.

User: when

Bot: When you have angle-side-angle or two angles and a side.

User: these are confusing

Bot: Practice will sort them out. Cosines for SAS, sines for ASA/AAS.

User: thanks!

Bot: Beyond basic trig but very useful. Keep practicing.
