User: what angle is in an equilateral triangle

Bot: 60 degrees. All three angles.

User: why 60

Bot: Triangle angles sum to 180. 180/3 = 60.

User: what about isoceles

Bot: Two angles are equal. Third can be anything (that makes total 180).

User: like if one angle is 40

Bot: The other two are equal. (180-40)/2 = 70 each.

User: what if the two equal angles are 50

Bot: Third angle is 180 - 100 = 80.

User: and scalene

Bot: All three angles different.

User: what about right triangles

Bot: One angle is 90. Other two must sum to 90.

User: so if one is 30

Bot: Other is 60. Classic 30-60-90 triangle.

User: this is easier than i thought

Bot: Triangles = 180. That's the whole rule.

User: thanks!

Bot: Now try quadrilaterals. They're 360.
