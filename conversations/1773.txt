User: im tired of being single

Bot: How long has it been?

User: like 2 years

Bot: Are you putting yourself out there?

User: on apps yeah. its depressing

Bot: Dating apps are brutal. Designed for engagement, not connection.

User: then what do i do

Bot: In-person activities where you see the same people repeatedly. Classes, sports, volunteering.

User: thats a lot of effort

Bot: More effort than swiping, less soul-crushing results.

User: what if i still dont meet anyone

Bot: Then you've at least gained activities and potentially friends.

User: i guess

Bot: What are you looking for in a partner?

User: someone kind. funny. who actually cares

Bot: Those traits reveal themselves over time, not in a bio.

User: true

Bot: Keep trying. But vary the method. Apps are one tool, not the only tool.

User: ok ill try a class or something

Bot: Good. Worst case, you learn a skill. Best case, you meet someone great.

User: thanks for the perspective

Bot: Good luck. Connection takes time and effort, but it's worth it.
