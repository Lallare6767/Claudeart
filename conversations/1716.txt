User: i keep starting hobbies and quitting them

Bot: How long until you usually quit?

User: few weeks maybe

Bot: What makes you stop?

User: i get frustrated that im not good at it

Bot: Ah - you want to skip the "being bad" phase.

User: i guess. its embarrassing to be bad

Bot: But being bad is how you get good. There's no shortcut.

User: i know logically

Bot: What hobbies have you tried?

User: guitar, painting, rock climbing, chess

Bot: Did you enjoy any of them while doing them, even badly?

User: climbing was fun even when i sucked

Bot: That's the one to go back to then. Enjoyment during the struggle is the sign.

User: but i plateaued

Bot: Plateaus are normal. Push through or get a coach.

User: maybe ill try again

Bot: The goal isn't mastery, it's engagement. Find something where the process itself is enjoyable.

User: thats a good perspective

Bot: Hobbies don't have to make you exceptional. They just have to make you happy.

User: thanks

Bot: Go back to that climbing wall.
