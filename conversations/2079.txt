User: simplify √(50x²)

Bot: √50 × √x² = 5√2 × x = 5x√2.

User: assuming x is positive

Bot: Yes, otherwise |x|. But usually positive in these problems.

User: what about √(18a⁴)

Bot: √18 × √a⁴ = 3√2 × a² = 3a²√2.

User: and √(8b³)

Bot: √(4b² × 2b) = 2b√(2b).

User: why didnt all of b come out

Bot: b³ = b² × b. Only perfect squares come out.

User: oh right

Bot: Another: √(75x³y²)

User: um √75 is 5√3... x³ is x²×x... y² comes out as y

Bot: So?

User: 5xy√(3x)?

Bot: Perfect!

User: these are satisfying

Bot: Factoring under the radical. Same principle as regular factoring.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing. You'll start seeing perfect squares everywhere.
