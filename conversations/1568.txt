User: i want to be more confident

Bot: Confidence in what context?

User: everywhere. work, social situations, life

Bot: That's broad. What does lack of confidence look like for you?

User: second-guessing myself. not speaking up. assuming people dont like me

Bot: Those are all different things. Self-doubt, behavioral hesitation, and negative assumptions about others.

User: so i have to work on all of them

Bot: You can start with one. Which affects you most?

User: probably assuming people dont like me

Bot: That's a mind-reading error. You're guessing what others think and assuming the worst.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Notice when you're doing it. Then ask: "What's my evidence?" Usually there isn't any.

User: but what if they actually dont like me

Bot: Then you'll find out through their behavior. You don't need to guess. Also - not everyone will like you and that's okay.

User: but it feels bad

Bot: Yes. But being disliked by some people is normal. Trying to be liked by everyone makes you bland.

User: thats a good point actually

Bot: Be yourself. Let people react. The ones who like you will, and they're the ones who matter.

User: ok ill try to notice the mind-reading

Bot: That's a good start. Confidence builds with practice.
