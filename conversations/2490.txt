User: love

Bot: Above, dove, glove, shove, of.

User: time

Bot: Rhyme, climb, prime, dime, lime, slime, crime, chime, mime.

User: orange

Bot: Nothing perfect. "Door hinge" is close. Sporange is a botanical term.

User: thats why people say orange has no rhyme

Bot: It has near rhymes but no perfect ones in common English.

User: what about silver

Bot: Chilver is a word (female lamb). But basically no common rhymes.

User: purple

Bot: Curple (horse's hindquarters). Again, basically nothing common.

User: english is weird

Bot: Many common words have no perfect rhymes.

User: how do poets handle it

Bot: Near rhymes, slant rhymes, or avoid those words.

User: slant rhyme

Bot: Close but not exact. Love/move. Time/lane.

User: useful

Bot: Expands options. Pure rhyme isn't always necessary.

User: thanks

Bot: What's the poem for?

User: just curious

Bot: Good curiosity. Language has interesting gaps.
