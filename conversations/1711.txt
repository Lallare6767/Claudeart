Bot: Have you asked them?

User: no im scared theyll confirm it

Bot: And then what?

User: then i have to deal with whatever i did

Bot: Which you can't fix if you don't know what it is.

User: i know i know

Bot: What makes you think they're mad?

User: short texts. not initiating plans. different vibe

Bot: That could be many things - their own stress, busy, or yes, something between you.

User: but what if i did something wrong

Bot: Then you find out, apologize, and work through it. That's what friends do.

User: what do i say

Bot: "Hey, I feel like something's off between us. Did I do something wrong?"

User: what if they say yes

Bot: Then you listen without getting defensive and apologize if needed.

User: and if they say no

Bot: Then maybe it's about them, not you. Either way, you've cleared the air.

User: ok ur right

Bot: Uncertainty is worse than knowing. Just ask.

User: i will

Bot: Good. Real friendships survive hard conversations.
