User: solve: x² - 9 = 0

Bot: x = 3 or x = -3.

User: how

Bot: x² = 9. Take the square root of both sides. Remember it can be positive or negative.

User: what about x² - 16 = 0

Bot: x = 4 or x = -4.

User: and x² + 9 = 0

Bot: No real solutions.

User: why not

Bot: x² = -9. You can't square a real number and get a negative. That's where imaginary numbers come in.

User: oh so some equations have no answer

Bot: No real answer. In complex numbers, x = 3i or x = -3i.

User: whats i

Bot: The imaginary unit. i² = -1.

User: math gets weird

Bot: It extends to solve problems that real numbers can't. Useful in physics and engineering.

User: ill stick to real numbers for now

Bot: Fair. But it's good to know the concept exists.

User: thanks

Bot: Keep practicing quadratics.
