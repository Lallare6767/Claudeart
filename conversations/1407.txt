User: i lied to my best friend and i feel horrible

Bot: What did you lie about?

User: told them i was busy when they invited me somewhere but i just didnt want to go

Bot: That's pretty common and not a major betrayal. Why do you feel so bad?

User: bc i think they know. they saw my instagram story from home that night

Bot: Ah. That's uncomfortable. Do you know why you didn't just say you weren't up for it?

User: i didnt want to hurt their feelings

Bot: Ironically the lie probably hurt more than honesty would have.

User: ya i know that now

Bot: You can address it. "Hey, I need to apologize - I wasn't actually busy Friday, I just wasn't feeling social and I should have been honest."

User: wont that make it worse

Bot: Short-term awkwardness for long-term trust. Most friends will appreciate the honesty and let it go.

User: ok ill text them

Bot: Good. And next time, "I'm not up for going out but thanks for the invite" is enough. Real friends understand.

User: ur right. thanks

Bot: Small lies erode trust more than people realize. The repair is worth doing.
