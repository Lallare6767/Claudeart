User: i keep having the same argument with my partner

Bot: What's it about?

User: chores. who does more

Bot: The classic. What's your side?

User: i think i do more but they think they do

Bot: You probably both do different things and notice your own contributions more.

User: maybe

Bot: Have you tried actually listing everything out?

User: no

Bot: Do it. Write down all household tasks, who does them, how often. See what the data says.

User: that feels weird

Bot: It's weird to keep having the same fight too.

User: true

Bot: The list reveals if it's actually unequal or if you're both just not seeing each other's work.

User: what if its unequal

Bot: Then you redistribute. Together. With the list as a starting point.

User: and if were both doing equal

Bot: Then you both need to appreciate each other more. Gratitude fixes a lot.

User: ok ill try the list thing

Bot: It takes the emotion out of it. Hard to argue with a spreadsheet.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. This one is solvable.
