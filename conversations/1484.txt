User: whats 25 squared

Bot: 625.

User: and 12 squared

Bot: 144.

User: any tricks for squaring numbers

Bot: For numbers ending in 5: multiply the first digit by (itself + 1), then add 25. So 25² = 2×3 = 6, then 625.

User: whoa thats cool. so 35 squared

Bot: 3×4 = 12, then 1225.

User: and 45

Bot: 4×5 = 20, then 2025.

User: thats amazing

Bot: Another trick: for numbers near 50, use (50-n)(50+n) + n². So 48² = 50×46 + 4 = 2300 + 4 = 2304.

User: ok that one is more complex

Bot: It is. The "5 at the end" trick is the easiest. Also useful: (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b². Break numbers into parts.

User: like 23 squared?

Bot: (20+3)² = 400 + 120 + 9 = 529.

User: ok thats actually faster in my head

Bot: Mental math is about finding shortcuts that work for you.

User: thanks!

Bot: Practice a few and they'll become automatic.
