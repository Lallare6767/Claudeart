User: HELP i need a last minute gift for my sister

Bot: When is "last minute" - hours or days?

User: 3 hours. her bday dinner is tonight

Bot: Okay, fast options: Nice candle, good chocolates, a plant from a local shop, or a gift card to somewhere she actually likes.

User: gift cards feel impersonal

Bot: Then pair it with something small and specific to her. "I got you a coffee shop card because I know you go every morning, plus this small thing that made me think of you."

User: ok what small thing

Bot: What is she into? Interests, hobbies?

User: she loves cooking and skincare

Bot: A unique spice or fancy olive oil + a nice face mask or hand cream. Both available at most grocery stores in the specialty sections.

User: oh truffle salt could be cool

Bot: That's perfect - specific enough to be thoughtful, available today. Pair with a good chocolate and a card.

User: ok im going to whole foods now

Bot: You've got this. It'll come together.

User: thanks u saved me

Bot: Happy to help. Have fun at dinner!
