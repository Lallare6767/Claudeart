User: i keep making the same mistakes in relationships

Bot: What pattern do you notice?

User: i choose unavailable people

Bot: Emotionally unavailable, or physically?

User: emotionally. they never really commit

Bot: Why do you think you're drawn to them?

User: i dont know

Bot: Sometimes unavailable people feel safe because they can't really hurt you.

User: how is that safe

Bot: If they were never fully in, you never fully risked.

User: oh

Bot: It's a protection mechanism. But it guarantees loneliness.

User: what do i do differently

Bot: Notice the red flags you're ignoring. Inconsistency, hot and cold, words not matching actions.

User: i see those but i explain them away

Bot: Stop doing that. Believe behavior, not potential.

User: thats hard

Bot: It is. But you deserve someone who's actually available.

User: ok ill try to be more aware

Bot: Awareness is the first step. But you also need to walk away when you see it.

User: yeah

Bot: You're worth more than crumbs of attention.
