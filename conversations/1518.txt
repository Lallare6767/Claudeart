User: i spent too much money this month and i feel guilty

Bot: How much over budget?

User: like $400

Bot: On what?

User: some was necessary. car repair. but also a lot of eating out and random stuff

Bot: Can you cover it without going into debt?

User: ya from savings. but thats the problem. i wanted to grow savings not shrink it

Bot: One month isn't a pattern. What made this month different?

User: stress maybe. i kept using shopping and food as comfort

Bot: Stress spending is real. Recognizing it is step one.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Find other comfort activities that don't cost money. Walk, bath, calling a friend. Replace the behavior.

User: easier said than done

Bot: True. But the guilt you feel now is data - remember this feeling next time you're tempted.

User: good point

Bot: Also try a 24-hour rule for non-essential purchases. Wait a day. Often the urge passes.

User: i should do that

Bot: Rebuild from here. One bad month is recoverable. Just learn from it.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You'll bounce back. Just be intentional.
