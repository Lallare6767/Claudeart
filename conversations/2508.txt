User: whats the difference between plot and story

Bot: Plot is what happens. Story is how it's told.

User: arent they the same

Bot: Plot: sequence of events. Story: those events plus meaning, emotion, perspective.

User: example

Bot: Plot: man searches for daughter's killer, finds him, kills him.

User: and story

Bot: Story includes his guilt, his relationship with daughter, the twist that changes everything.

User: so story is bigger

Bot: Story is the experience. Plot is the skeleton.

User: can you have plot without story

Bot: Technically. It would be a summary.

User: and story without plot?

Bot: Some experimental literature tries. Usually still has some plot.

User: which matters more

Bot: Depends who you ask. Plot hooks you. Story stays with you.

User: so both

Bot: Ideally yes. Great works have both.

User: thanks

Bot: When analyzing, ask: what happened? Then: what does it mean? Plot then story.
