User: whats the circumference of a circle

Bot: 2πr or πd. r = radius, d = diameter.

User: whats π again

Bot: Approximately 3.14159. Use 3.14 for most calculations.

User: so if radius is 5

Bot: Circumference = 2 × 3.14 × 5 = 31.4.

User: and if diameter is 10

Bot: Same answer. π × 10 = 31.4.

User: why are they the same

Bot: Diameter is 2 × radius. So 2πr = πd.

User: oh duh

Bot: What about area?

User: um πr²

Bot: So area with radius 5?

User: 3.14 × 25 = 78.5

Bot: Perfect. Circle formulas are some of the most useful.

User: why is π in both

Bot: Pi is the ratio of circumference to diameter. It's fundamental to circles.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Remember: circumference around, area inside.

User: got it

Bot: Practice with different radii. Becomes automatic.
