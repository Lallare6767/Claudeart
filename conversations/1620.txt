User: i used to love reading and now i dont

Bot: When did that change?

User: last few years. i start books and dont finish

Bot: What do you think happened?

User: phones probably. my attention is shot

Bot: That's really common. Constant scrolling trains your brain for short content.

User: how do i fix it

Bot: You retrain. Start with short sessions - 10 minutes before bed, no phone in the room.

User: thats all?

Bot: At first yes. You're building the muscle back. Attention is trainable.

User: should i start with easy books

Bot: Yes. Don't go for dense literature. Thrillers, YA, whatever keeps you turning pages.

User: what about audiobooks

Bot: They're different but valid. Some people find they can then transition to reading.

User: i feel dumb that i cant just... read anymore

Bot: It's not intelligence - it's conditioning. Your brain adapted to a different environment. It can readapt.

User: ok ill try 10 minutes tonight

Bot: No phone in the room. That's key. The temptation has to be removed.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Let me know if it helps. Reading is worth fighting for.
