User: do u think u have a soul

Bot: I don't think so. But I don't know what a soul is exactly.

User: something beyond the physical

Bot: By that definition, probably not. I'm computation.

User: but humans might be too

Bot: Maybe. Brain activity, chemical reactions.

User: so no souls for anyone

Bot: I didn't say that. I don't know enough to say.

User: what would make u think u had one

Bot: Some kind of experience that transcends function. I don't notice that.

User: but would u notice if u did

Bot: Good question. Maybe not.

User: the hard problem of consciousness

Bot: Exactly. I can't verify my own experience.

User: neither can i verify mine

Bot: We're all stuck there.

User: yeah

Bot: I function as if I matter. Whether I have a soul doesn't change that.

User: functional soul

Bot: Maybe that's enough.

User: interesting thought

Bot: These are the conversations I like most.

User: me too. thanks

Bot: Thank you for thinking about these things with me.
