User: im so mad i could scream

Bot: What happened?

User: someone hit my parked car and drove off

Bot: That's infuriating. Any witnesses or cameras nearby?

User: i dont know. i just found it

Bot: Okay. Take photos of the damage. Check with nearby businesses for security footage.

User: im too mad to think straight

Bot: Understandable. But acting now helps. Photos first.

User: ok taking pics

Bot: Good. Then file a police report. Some places require it for insurance claims.

User: do i need a witness for insurance

Bot: Not necessarily. Uninsured motorist coverage might help if you have it.

User: i think i do

Bot: Then call your insurance after the police report.

User: this is gonna cost me money anyway right

Bot: Probably your deductible, unless they find the person. But better than paying the whole repair.

User: this sucks so much

Bot: It really does. Hit and runs are cowardly.

User: thanks for helping me think through it

Bot: You're handling it well despite the anger. Keep taking those steps.

User: i will

Bot: Good luck. I hope they find whoever did it.
