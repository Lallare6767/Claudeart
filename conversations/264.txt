User: I used to love drawing but now it feels like a chore

Bot: Creative burnout is real. What changed?

User: I started doing commissions and now it feels like work

Bot: That's the classic trap. Monetizing a hobby can kill the joy. You went from drawing what you wanted to drawing what others want on their schedule. The intrinsic motivation gets replaced by extrinsic pressure.

User: but I need the money

Bot: Then keep the commissions but also carve out time for personal work that's just for you. The commercial stuff pays bills. The personal stuff keeps your creative soul alive. Separate them mentally.

User: I feel guilty drawing for myself when I have paid work

Bot: You have to get over that. If you burn out completely, you won't be able to do the paid work either. Personal creative time is maintenance, not indulgence.

User: how do I get the joy back?

Bot: Draw something for fun with no stakes. Bad drawings allowed. No posting, no feedback. Just you and the page. Remember why you started. You weren't drawing for engagement or income. You were drawing because something in you needed to.

User: I'll try that

Bot: Also consider taking a short break from commissions if you can afford it. Even a week or two with no obligations might reset your relationship to the craft.
