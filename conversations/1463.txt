User: helena

Bot: Correct. Oregon?

User: salem

Bot: Right. How about Kentucky?

User: louisville?

User: ugh i always get that wrong. ok keep going

Bot: New York?

User: albany

Bot: Correct. Vermont?

User: montpelier

Bot: Yes! Missouri?

User: kansas city?

Bot: No, Jefferson City. Another case where the largest city isn't the capital.

User: why is that so common

Bot: Often the capital was chosen for being central to the state or for political reasons - not because it was the biggest.

User: thats annoying to memorize

Bot: Focus on the ones that trip people up: New York-Albany, California-Sacramento, Illinois-Springfield, Florida-Tallahassee.

User: those are all not the big cities

Bot: Exactly. That's the pattern. If you think the capital is the famous city, it's probably not.

User: ok helpful. thanks for the quiz

Bot: Anytime. You knew most of them.
