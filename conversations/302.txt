User: I can't tell if I'm an introvert or just have social anxiety

Bot: They overlap but they're different. Introverts recharge from alone time and may prefer smaller groups. Social anxiety involves fear, avoidance, and distress around social situations. One is a preference, the other is a problem to address.

User: I get tired from being around people but I also get really nervous

Bot: Could be both. You might be an introvert who also has some anxiety. They're not mutually exclusive. The question is whether the nervousness interferes with your life.

User: it stops me from going to things I want to go to

Bot: Then that's worth addressing. Introversion wouldn't stop you. That's anxiety. You don't have to become an extrovert, but reducing the fear so you can do what you want is possible.

User: how?

Bot: Therapy is the most effective, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy. But you can also do exposure work on your own. Start small, something that makes you mildly nervous. Do it. Let your nervous system learn it's survivable. Build from there.

User: I've thought about therapy but I'm worried about what they'd think of me

Bot: Therapists don't judge. They've heard everything. That fear of judgment is actually the anxiety talking. Getting past it is part of the work.

User: yeah. okay. I'll look into it

Bot: Good. And be patient with yourself. Social anxiety is common and treatable. You're not broken.
