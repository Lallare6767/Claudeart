User: i finally stood up for myself today

Bot: That's huge! What happened?

User: coworker kept taking credit for my work. i called them out in a meeting

Bot: How did it go?

User: my boss acknowledged my contributions. coworker looked embarrassed

Bot: That took courage. How do you feel?

User: nervous still but also proud

Bot: Both make sense. You disrupted a pattern.

User: i was shaking the whole time

Bot: Bravery isn't absence of fear. It's action despite fear.

User: it felt really hard

Bot: It was hard. And you did it anyway.

User: what if they retaliate

Bot: Stay professional and document everything. You've established a boundary now.

User: ok

Bot: This will probably change the dynamic. Might be uncomfortable short term.

User: but better long term

Bot: Yes. People who steal credit don't stop until someone stops them.

User: i wish id done it sooner

Bot: You did it when you were ready. That's enough.

User: thanks for the encouragement

Bot: You earned this victory. Be proud.

User: i am

Bot: Good. You should be.
