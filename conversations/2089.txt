Bot: You tell me. When do you notice it?

User: stressful situations. or random times

Bot: How long has this been going on?

User: years

Bot: Have you told anyone?

User: no. thought i was just weird

Bot: You're not weird. This is your brain protecting you.

User: from what

Bot: Overwhelming feelings. It numbs you out.

User: how do i stop it

Bot: Grounding techniques help. 5 things you see, 4 you hear, etc.

User: ok

Bot: But really, see a therapist. Chronic dissociation needs professional help.

User: ok

Bot: You shouldn't have to live in your head. Your body is yours too.

User: thanks

Bot: Take this seriously. It's your brain telling you something.
