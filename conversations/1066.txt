User: tell me im going to be okay

Bot: I can't promise that because I don't know what you're going through. But I can tell you this: you're here, you're reaching out, and that means you're fighting. Whatever's happening, those are good signs.

What's going on?

User: i just feel so overwhelmed rn

Bot: What's overwhelming you? Work, life, everything at once?

User: everything. like i cant even make a list bc its all tangled up

Bot: Okay. When it's that tangled, you don't have to untangle it all right now. You just have to get through the next hour. Can you do that?

User: ya i think so

Bot: Good. Then just focus on that. The rest will still be there but you don't have to solve it all at once.

Also: overwhelm often signals that you're trying to do too much alone. Is there someone you can ask for help?

User: maybe my sister

Bot: Reach out to her. Not to solve everything, just to not be alone with it. Overwhelm shrinks when it's shared.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You're going to get through this. I don't know how long it'll take, but you will. One hour at a time.
