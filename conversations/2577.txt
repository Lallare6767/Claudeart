User: someone at work makes comments about my weight

Bot: What kind of comments?

User: "jokes" about what i eat. how much i eat.

Bot: That's harassment. Not jokes.

User: i try to laugh it off

Bot: You shouldn't have to. Have you told them to stop?

User: no i dont want to seem sensitive

Bot: Asking someone to stop mocking your body isn't being sensitive.

User: will they take it seriously

Bot: Maybe not. But you'll have said it.

User: what if they dont stop

Bot: Then it's HR's problem.

User: i dont want to get them fired

Bot: They should have thought about that before harassing you.

User: i guess

Bot: Your body isn't their commentary topic. Period.

User: ok ill say something

Bot: Good. "Don't comment on my body or food." Clear and direct.

User: thanks

Bot: You deserve to work without being mocked. Stand up for yourself.
