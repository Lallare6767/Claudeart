User: i want to get better at small talk

Bot: What do you struggle with specifically?

User: starting convos. sustaining them

Bot: Small talk is just a ritual to establish rapport. Low stakes.

User: it feels high stakes to me

Bot: Because you're focused on yourself instead of the other person.

User: what do u mean

Bot: You're worried about seeming boring or awkward. Flip it: be curious about them.

User: what do i say

Bot: FORD: Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. Safe universal topics.

User: that seems formulaic

Bot: All social skills are formulas until they become natural.

User: how do i keep it going

Bot: Follow up questions. "Oh you're from Portland? How do you like it compared to here?"

User: and if it stalls

Bot: Gracefully exit. "Well, nice talking to you!" No need to force it.

User: what if we have nothing in common

Bot: You just need enough to get through the conversation. You're not finding a best friend.

User: ok true

Bot: Small talk is a skill. Practice it like any other.

User: ill try FORD

Bot: Good start. You'll get better with reps.
