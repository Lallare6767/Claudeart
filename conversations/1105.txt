User: damn ur good

Bot: These are classics. The letter-based riddles are always about counting occurrences in the word itself rather than the concept.

User: ok try this one: i speak without a mouth and hear without ears. i have no body but i come alive with wind

User: YES finally one that took u a second

Bot: That one's nice because "come alive with wind" is poetic misdirection. Good riddle.
