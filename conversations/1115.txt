User: whats 3/4 plus 2/3

Bot: First find a common denominator. 12 works.

3/4 = 9/12
2/3 = 8/12

9/12 + 8/12 = 17/12 = 1 and 5/12

User: ok what about 5/6 minus 1/4

Bot: Common denominator 12 again.

5/6 = 10/12
1/4 = 3/12

10/12 - 3/12 = 7/12

User: and 2/5 times 3/7

Bot: Just multiply across: 2×3 = 6, 5×7 = 35.

2/5 × 3/7 = 6/35

User: and divide 3/4 by 2/3

Bot: Flip and multiply: 3/4 × 3/2 = 9/8 = 1 and 1/8

User: ur like a fraction calculator

Bot: Pretty much. The rules are mechanical once you know them - find common denominators for add/subtract, multiply straight across, flip and multiply for division.

User: ya i think i got it now. thanks

Bot: Nice. Fractions click once the patterns become automatic.
