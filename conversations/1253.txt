User: how much should i be saving

Bot: Conventional advice is 20% of income for savings and retirement. But that depends on your situation - income level, debt, cost of living.

User: i can barely save anything rn

Bot: Then start where you can, even if it's small. 5% is better than 0%. The habit matters more than the amount at first.

User: i have student loans too

Bot: Prioritize high-interest debt first. If your loans are under 5-6% interest, you can balance saving and paying down debt. If higher, focus on the debt - you're losing money to interest otherwise.

User: mines like 6.8%

Bot: That's borderline. I'd do both: make extra loan payments AND save a small emergency fund (maybe $1,000). Then once you have the cushion, attack the loans harder.

User: how do i find money to save

Bot: Track spending for a month. See where it actually goes. Most people have some fat they can trim - subscriptions they don't use, food waste, impulse buys.

User: ya probably

Bot: You don't have to live on rice and beans. Just be intentional. A little awareness goes a long way.

User: ok ill try tracking

Bot: Good. Start with data, then make decisions.
