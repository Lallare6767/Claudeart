Bot: Behind compared to whom?

User: everyone. friends are married have kids houses

Bot: And you want those things?

User: i think so

Bot: "Think so" isn't a yes.

User: i want them because im supposed to

Bot: That's a terrible reason to build a life.

User: but i feel like a failure

Bot: You're not behind. You're on a different path.

User: feels like excuses

Bot: Would you rather have the wrong house and wrong marriage, or wait for the right ones?

User: when u put it that way

Bot: Life isn't a checklist. There's no deadline except death.

User: dark

Bot: But true. You have time. Use it to build what you actually want.

User: i need to figure out what that is

Bot: That's the real work. Forget the timeline. Define your goals.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Stop comparing your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 20.
