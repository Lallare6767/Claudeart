User: help me write a thank you note to my therapist

Bot: That's thoughtful. What do you want to thank her for specifically?

User: shes helped me so much over the past year. i feel like a different person

Bot: Any specific moments or things she said that stuck with you?

User: she always made me feel heard and helped me see patterns i was blind to

Bot: Here's a draft:

"Thank you for everything this past year. You've helped me become someone I actually like. The way you listen and help me see my own patterns has changed my life. I'm grateful to have found you."

User: thats really nice but maybe a little less intense?

Bot: "Thank you for everything this year. You've helped me see things clearly and I've grown so much because of it. I really appreciate you."

User: perfect. shorter but still sincere

Bot: Good. Therapists don't hear enough direct appreciation. She'll be glad to receive this.

User: ya i figured she deserves to know shes making a difference

Bot: She absolutely does. Send it.
