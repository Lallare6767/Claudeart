User: my friend is going thru a hard time and idk how to help

Bot: What are they dealing with?

User: breakup. they were together 5 years

Bot: That's significant. What have you been doing so far?

User: just listening mostly. but it feels like its not enough

Bot: Listening is often exactly what's needed. The instinct to fix things can actually be less helpful than just being present.

User: really? i feel useless just sitting there

Bot: You're not useless - you're providing consistent support. That matters more than advice right now.

User: should i suggest therapy or anything

Bot: You can mention it's an option, but don't push. They'll seek it when they're ready.

User: ok. i just wish i could do more

Bot: The "more" is continuing to show up. Grief from a long relationship takes time. Your job is to not disappear.

User: i wont. theyre my best friend

Bot: Then keep doing what you're doing. Your presence is the help.

User: thanks. that actually helps me feel better about it

Bot: You're being a good friend. That's all you can control.
