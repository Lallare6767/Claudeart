User: im jealous of my sibling and feel awful about it

Bot: Jealous of what?

User: they have a great career and relationship and im struggling

Bot: Comparison to siblings is especially painful. You grew up with the same resources.

User: exactly it feels like i failed

Bot: You're living different lives. Same start, different paths.

User: but theyre doing better

Bot: By some metrics. Do you know their struggles?

User: they seem happy

Bot: They might be. They might also have problems you don't see.

User: i guess

Bot: The jealousy is telling you something though. What do you want that they have?

User: stability mostly

Bot: Then work toward stability. Their success doesn't prevent yours.

User: it feels like it does

Bot: That's scarcity mindset. Their good things don't take good things from you.

User: i know logically

Bot: Logic doesn't kill the feeling. But it can help you respond to it better.

User: thanks

Bot: Use the jealousy as data about what you want. Then pursue it directly.

User: ok

Bot: You'll get where you want to go. Different timeline isn't failure.
