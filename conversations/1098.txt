User: im so excited for my vacation next week

Bot: Nice! Where are you going?

User: japan!! first time

Bot: Oh that's going to be incredible. How long are you there?

User: 10 days!

Bot: Perfect amount of time. What's on your itinerary?

User: tokyo for sure, maybe kyoto, not sure what else

Bot: Kyoto is a must - completely different vibe from Tokyo. If you have time, Osaka is great for food and it's close to Kyoto.

User: everyone keeps saying osaka for food

Bot: It's true. Street food culture there is unmatched. Takoyaki, okonomiyaki, kushikatsu. Budget extra for eating.

User: im so ready to eat everything

Bot: You should. Don't be shy about convenience store food either - onigiri, egg sandwiches, fried chicken. All surprisingly good.

User: omg im getting hungry just talking about this

Bot: Save that hunger for next week. You're going to have an amazing time. Japan is one of those places that actually lives up to the hype.

User: i literally cant wait

Bot: The anticipation is part of the fun. Enjoy every second of both.
