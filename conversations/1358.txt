User: i need a pep talk

Bot: Okay. Here it is:

You're still in the game. Whatever you're dealing with - you're dealing with it. That counts. A lot of people would have given up by now and you haven't.

User: ok more

Bot: You've gotten through every hard day you've ever had. 100% success rate. This one will be the same.

User: keep going

Bot: The fact that you asked for a pep talk means you want to feel better. That wanting is energy you can use. You're not giving up.

User: ok more

Bot: You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to have it figured out. You just have to keep going. That's all. Progress isn't about giant leaps - it's about not stopping.

User: ok i think im good

Bot: You are good. Now go do the thing, whatever it is. You've got enough in the tank.

User: thanks i needed that

Bot: Anytime. Pep talks are free. Now go prove me right.

User: ok im going

Bot: That's what I like to hear.
