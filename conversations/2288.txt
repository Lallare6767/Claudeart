User: i think i need therapy but im scared

Bot: What scares you about it?

User: being judged. saying stuff out loud

Bot: Therapists are trained not to judge. It's literally their job.

User: what if i cry

Bot: You probably will. That's normal and okay.

User: seems weak

Bot: It's the opposite. Vulnerability in service of growth is strength.

User: what if they think my problems are dumb

Bot: They won't. And even if they seem small, your pain is valid.

User: how do i even start

Bot: Ask your doctor for a referral. Or search Psychology Today's directory.

User: do i need a diagnosis

Bot: No. You just need to want help. That's enough.

User: its expensive

Bot: Check if your insurance covers it. Many therapists offer sliding scales too.

User: ok

Bot: First session is just talking. See if you connect. No commitment.

User: what if i dont like them

Bot: Find another. Fit matters. It's okay to shop around.

User: ok i'll look into it

Bot: Proud of you for considering it. That's the hardest step.
