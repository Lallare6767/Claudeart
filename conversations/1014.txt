User: im worried im wasting my 20s

Bot: What makes you feel that way? What do you think you should be doing that you're not?

User: idk everyone else seems to be doing stuff. traveling, getting promotions, getting married

Bot: Social media makes it look like everyone's living their best life. They're not. They're posting highlights while also feeling lost and uncertain. The 20s are messy for almost everyone.

User: i just feel behind

Bot: Behind what timeline? There isn't one. People marry at 22 and divorce at 30. People start businesses at 35 and succeed at 40. The idea that there's a schedule is a myth that makes people miserable.

User: but what if i look back and regret not doing more

Bot: That's possible. But doing things just to avoid future regret isn't living - it's performing. What do YOU actually want? Not what looks good, not what your friends are doing. What would feel meaningful to you?

User: honestly i dont know

Bot: That's okay. That's actually a better starting point than doing random things to check boxes. The 20s are often about figuring out what you want. Give yourself permission for that to be the work right now.

User: i guess i feel like i should know by now

Bot: Says who? Most people don't. The ones who seem certain are often just confidently wrong. Stay curious, try things, pay attention to what energizes you and what drains you. The clarity comes from experience, not from sitting and thinking.

User: thanks. this actually helped

Bot: I'm glad. And go easy on yourself. You're not behind. You're just living.
