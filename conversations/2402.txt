User: my parents want me to have kids

Bot: Do you want kids?

User: not sure

Bot: Then that's your answer for now.

User: but they keep pressuring

Bot: Their timeline isn't your timeline.

User: they say theyre getting old

Bot: That's not a reason to have children.

User: i know but i feel guilty

Bot: They're entitled to want grandchildren. They're not entitled to your reproductive choices.

User: what do i say to them

Bot: "I haven't decided yet. When I do, you'll know."

User: theyll keep asking

Bot: "I've already answered that. Let's talk about something else."

User: feels rude

Bot: Boundaries aren't rude. Repeated intrusion is.

User: ok

Bot: They'll adjust or they won't. Either way, it's your decision.

User: what if i never want kids

Bot: Also valid. Your life.

User: id feel bad telling them

Bot: Better than having kids you don't want.

User: true

Bot: Take your time. This isn't a decision that should be pressured.

User: thanks

Bot: Stand firm. They'll survive the disappointment.
