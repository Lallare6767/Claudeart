User: if a train leaves chicago at 9am going 60mph and another leaves nyc at 10am going 80mph

Bot: I'll need the distance between them to solve this. What are you trying to find - when they meet?

User: ya assume 800 miles apart

Bot: Let t = hours after 9am when they meet.
Chicago train travels 60t miles.
NYC train leaves an hour later, so travels 80(t-1) miles.
Together they cover 800 miles: 60t + 80(t-1) = 800.

User: ok solve it

Bot: 60t + 80t - 80 = 800
140t = 880
t = 880/140 = 6.29 hours after 9am.

User: so what time

Bot: About 3:17pm.

User: where do they meet

Bot: Chicago train went 60 × 6.29 = 377 miles from Chicago. NYC train went 80 × 5.29 = 423 miles from NYC. They meet about 377 miles from Chicago.

User: these problems always confused me

Bot: Break them into pieces: write what each thing does, set up the equation, solve. The setup is the hard part.

User: ok that helps

Bot: Practice a few more and it'll click.
