User: help me plan a surprise party

Bot: Fun! Who's it for and what's the occasion?

User: my partners 30th

Bot: Big one. What's your budget and how many people?

User: maybe $500. like 20 people

Bot: Okay that's doable. At your place or somewhere else?

User: our place. they work late so i can set up

Bot: Good. Key elements: decorations, food, cake, guest coordination.

User: what about getting them there without suspecting

Bot: Classic move: have a friend or family member take them out for a "birthday dinner" and redirect to your place.

User: oh smart. then everyone yells surprise

Bot: Exactly. Make sure all guests arrive at least 15 minutes early and stay quiet.

User: what food should i do

Bot: For 20 people on $500 - consider heavy appetizers instead of full meal. Cheaper and easier. Finger foods, veggie trays, a charcuterie board.

User: and cake

Bot: Order from a bakery - $30-50 for a good one. Don't try to make it unless you bake.

User: i dont. ok anything else

Bot: Create a group chat for coordination. Give people a deadline to RSVP. Assign someone to distract your partner if they come home early.

User: this is helpful. thanks!

Bot: Have fun! 30 is worth celebrating.
