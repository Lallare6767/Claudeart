User: i said something mean to my friend and i feel awful

Bot: What did you say?

User: i made fun of something they're insecure about. it was supposed to be a joke

Bot: But it landed wrong.

User: yeah. they got quiet and left early

Bot: Have you apologized?

User: not yet. im embarrassed

Bot: The longer you wait, the worse it gets. Apologize soon.

User: what do i even say

Bot: "I'm sorry for what I said. It was cruel and I shouldn't have joked about that. I feel terrible."

User: should i explain i was joking

Bot: No. The intent doesn't matter - the harm does. Don't minimize it with "but I was just joking."

User: ok youre right

Bot: A real apology takes responsibility without excuses.

User: what if they dont forgive me

Bot: That's their right. You apologize because it's right, not to guarantee a specific response.

User: that makes sense

Bot: But most people do forgive sincere apologies. Especially from friends.

User: ok im gonna text them now

Bot: Good. Own it fully. That's what friends do.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. This is the right move.
