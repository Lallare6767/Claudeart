User: i want to start running but i hate running

Bot: Then why running?

User: its free and i can do it anywhere

Bot: Those are practical reasons. What do you hate about it?

User: its boring. it hurts. i feel slow

Bot: Those are all beginner problems that improve with time.

User: how long

Bot: The discomfort: a few weeks. The boredom: music, podcasts, or scenic routes.

User: what about being slow

Bot: Slow is fine. You're running for fitness, not competition.

User: i compare myself to other runners

Bot: Everyone started somewhere. Most fast runners were once slow beginners.

User: how do i start

Bot: Couch to 5K programs. Walk/run intervals. Very gradual.

User: like how gradual

Bot: Week 1 might be 30 seconds running, 90 seconds walking. Repeat.

User: thats barely running

Bot: That's the point. You build up without injury or burnout.

User: ok ill try an app

Bot: Give it 8 weeks before you decide if you like it. It takes that long to become a runner.

User: thats long

Bot: But it works. You'll hate it less over time.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck. The first month is the hardest.
