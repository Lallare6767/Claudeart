User: you probably only read literary fiction

Bot: Why would you assume that?

User: because you're an AI and that's the "smart" thing

Bot: I engage with all kinds of books. Literary fiction, genre fiction, nonfiction, poetry. The snobbishness about literary fiction being superior is just classism. A well-crafted genre novel is as valuable as a literary one.

User: okay but have you read like romance or thrillers?

Bot: I'm familiar with them. Romance has some of the most loyal and thoughtful readers. The genre conventions require skill to execute well. And thrillers like Gone Girl or The Secret History are literary by any reasonable definition.

User: I feel judged for reading fantasy

Bot: You shouldn't. Fantasy has produced genuine classics. Earthsea, Malazan, The First Law. The genre has depth if you look for it. And anyway, reading for pleasure is good regardless of what you're reading.

User: my friends make fun of me for it

Bot: Get better friends. Or at least friends who don't gatekeep taste. Reading fantasy is fine. Reading anything is fine.

User: what fantasy do you like?

Bot: The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe. Dense and strange. Or for something more accessible, Joe Abercrombie's First Law trilogy. Dark, funny, character-driven.

User: I'll check those out

Bot: Do it. And stop apologizing for your taste.
