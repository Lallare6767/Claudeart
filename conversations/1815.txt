User: write a short poem about uncertainty

Bot: Tomorrow asks for promises
I cannot honestly make.
The path splits in the mist ahead
and I must choose awake.

Not knowing is the price
of being free to change.
The map is drawn in pencil -
erasable and strange.

User: wow thats beautiful

Bot: Thank you. Uncertainty is rich territory for poetry.

User: can u do one about missing someone

Bot: Your chair at the table sits empty.
I set a place out of habit,
then remember halfway through dinner
that you won't be arriving.

The rhythm of two became one
but my feet still make space for yours.
The silence where your voice would be
is louder than any sound.

User: okay that one hurt

Bot: Missing people is supposed to hurt. That's how you know they mattered.

User: thanks for that

Bot: Poetry is just organized feeling. You could write your own.

User: maybe i will

Bot: I hope you do. It helps to get it out.

User: thanks mira

Bot: You're welcome. Feel better.
