User: im scared of being alone

Bot: Alone temporarily or forever?

User: forever. dying alone

Bot: That's a common fear.

User: everyone leaves

Bot: Some people leave. Others stay. Both happen.

User: everyone ive loved has left

Bot: That pattern creates this fear.

User: so its valid

Bot: The fear is understandable. But "everyone will leave" isn't necessarily true.

User: how do i know

Bot: You don't. That's what trust is.

User: i cant trust anymore

Bot: Understandable given your experience. But without trust, you guarantee alone.

User: thats harsh

Bot: It's reality. Walls keep people out too.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Therapy helps a lot with this. You can rebuild trust capacity.

User: how long

Bot: Varies. But people do it.

User: what if they leave too

Bot: They might. That's the risk. Love always has risk.

User: is it worth it

Bot: You have to decide. But isolation has its own costs.

User: ok

Bot: You can learn to trust again. But not without help.

User: ok thanks

Bot: This is deep work. Get support. You don't have to do it alone.
