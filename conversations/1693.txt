User: my grandpa died last week

Bot: I'm so sorry for your loss. How are you holding up?

User: not great. we were close

Bot: Tell me about him.

User: he was funny. always had a joke. taught me to fish

Bot: He sounds wonderful. Those fishing memories must mean a lot.

User: they do. i keep thinking about them

Bot: Good. Hold onto those. Grief doesn't mean forgetting - it means carrying them differently.

User: i cried at the funeral. felt embarrassed

Bot: Why embarrassed? Crying at a funeral is appropriate and healthy.

User: i dont usually cry in front of people

Bot: It's okay to let people see you grieve. That's what funerals are for.

User: i guess

Bot: How are you taking care of yourself this week?

User: not really. just working and sleeping

Bot: Give yourself permission to not be okay for a while. Grief takes time.

User: how much time

Bot: Different for everyone. Months to feel functional, maybe longer to feel normal. There's no schedule.

User: thanks for listening

Bot: I'm here. Your grandpa sounds like he was worth missing.

User: he was

Bot: Honor him by keeping those stories alive.
