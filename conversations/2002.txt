User: whats the area of a triangle

Bot: Base × height ÷ 2.

User: why divide by 2

Bot: A triangle is half of a rectangle with the same base and height.

User: oh that makes sense

Bot: What's the base and height you're working with?

User: base 8 height 5

Bot: Area = 8 × 5 ÷ 2 = 20.

User: what if i have three sides but no height

Bot: Use Heron's formula. Need all three side lengths.

User: sides are 5 6 7

Bot: Semi-perimeter s = (5+6+7)/2 = 9. Area = √(9×4×3×2) = √216 ≈ 14.7.

User: thats complicated

Bot: It is. That's why base × height ÷ 2 is preferred when you have the height.

User: how do i find height if i dont have it

Bot: Drop a perpendicular from vertex to base. Or use trigonometry if you have angles.

User: ok thanks

Bot: For most problems, you'll have the height. Don't worry about Heron's unless you need it.
