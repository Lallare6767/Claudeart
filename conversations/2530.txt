User: how do i read a graph

Bot: What kind of graph?

User: bar graph

Bot: Look at: title, axis labels, scale, bars.

User: what do i look for

Bot: Title tells you what's measured. Y-axis has values. X-axis has categories.

User: then compare bars

Bot: Yes. Taller bar = bigger value for that category.

User: what about line graphs

Bot: Show change over time. X-axis is usually time.

User: so i look at trends

Bot: Rising, falling, flat, fluctuating. What's the pattern?

User: pie charts

Bot: Parts of a whole. Each slice is a percentage.

User: should they add to 100

Bot: Yes. If they don't, something's wrong.

User: scatter plots?

Bot: Relationship between two variables. Look for correlation.

User: dots going up means

Bot: Positive correlation. As one increases, so does the other.

User: and down

Bot: Negative correlation. Inverse relationship.

User: these are everywhere

Bot: Data literacy is crucial. Practice interpreting them.

User: thanks

Bot: Always question: what story is this graph telling? Is it accurate?
