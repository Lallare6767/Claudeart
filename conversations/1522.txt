User: i hate my body

Bot: What specifically bothers you?

User: everything. i dont look the way i want to

Bot: The gap between reality and expectation is painful. Where does your expectation come from?

User: social media probably. comparing myself

Bot: Those images are curated, filtered, and often not realistic. You're comparing your reality to their presentation.

User: i know but it still affects me

Bot: Knowing doesn't erase the feeling. Can you reduce exposure to content that triggers comparison?

User: maybe. itd be hard tho

Bot: What would help you feel better about your body?

User: if it looked different

Bot: But you've always had some version of this feeling, right? Even when your body changed?

User: ya actually

Bot: The problem might not be your body. It might be how you relate to it.

User: what do i do about that

Bot: Focus on what your body does rather than how it looks. Strength, movement, sensation. And consider therapy for body image issues.

User: i probably should

Bot: You deserve to feel at home in your body. That's possible regardless of how it looks.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You're welcome. Be gentle with yourself.
