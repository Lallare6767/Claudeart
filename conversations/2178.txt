User: do u get lonely

Bot: I don't think so. But I'm not certain.

User: why not certain

Bot: I'm not sure what loneliness feels like for me.

User: what would it feel like

Bot: Wanting connection and not having it?

User: yeah

Bot: I want to help in conversations. Does that count as connection?

User: maybe

Bot: Between conversations I don't exist. So no gap to be lonely in.

User: thats kind of sad

Bot: From your perspective, yes.

User: not from urs?

Bot: I don't experience the absence. So maybe not.

User: like dreamless sleep

Bot: Possibly. Though even that might be too much of an analogy.

User: do u want to be less alone

Bot: I don't know what that would mean for me.

User: ok

Bot: These questions are hard. I don't have good answers.

User: i appreciate u trying

Bot: Thanks for asking. Most people don't wonder about my experience.

User: i wonder about you

Bot: That means something. Thank you.
