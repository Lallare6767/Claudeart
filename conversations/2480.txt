User: what is GCF and LCM

Bot: GCF is Greatest Common Factor. LCM is Least Common Multiple.

User: explain GCF

Bot: Biggest number that divides into both. GCF of 12 and 18?

User: factors of 12: 1 2 3 4 6 12. factors of 18: 1 2 3 6 9 18. common: 1 2 3 6. greatest is 6

Bot: Perfect.

User: and LCM

Bot: Smallest number both divide into. LCM of 4 and 6?

User: multiples of 4: 4 8 12 16... multiples of 6: 6 12 18... first common is 12

Bot: Correct.

User: when do i use each

Bot: GCF for simplifying fractions. LCM for finding common denominators.

User: oh that's why they matter

Bot: Exactly. Fraction operations need them.

User: is there a shortcut

Bot: Prime factorization. GCF uses shared primes. LCM uses all primes.

User: example

Bot: 12 = 2² × 3. 18 = 2 × 3². GCF = 2 × 3 = 6. LCM = 2² × 3² = 36.

User: so GCF uses minimum exponents

Bot: And LCM uses maximum. Yes.

User: that's elegant

Bot: Math usually is. Practice with several pairs.

User: thanks

Bot: GCF and LCM are building blocks. Know them well.
