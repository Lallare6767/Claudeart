User: help me rember the order of planets

Bot: Here's a classic mnemonic:

**My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos**

Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune

Each first letter matches a planet in order from the sun.

User: oo i like that one. any others

Bot: Sure:

- **My Very Easy Method Just Speeds Up Names** (more generic)
- **My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas** (old one that included Pluto)

Or make up your own! Personal ones stick better because you created them.

User: why isnt pluto a planet anymore

Bot: Pluto got reclassified as a "dwarf planet" in 2006. The International Astronomical Union decided a planet has to: orbit the sun, have enough mass for gravity to make it round, and have "cleared its orbit" of other debris. Pluto fails that third one - it shares its orbital neighborhood with other objects in the Kuiper Belt.

User: that seems harsh

Bot: A lot of people thought so! There was actual public outrage. Pluto was beloved. But the decision was about scientific consistency, not popularity. If Pluto counted, you'd have to include a bunch of other similar objects.

User: ill always consider it a planet in my heart

Bot: Same. Pluto deserves our loyalty.
