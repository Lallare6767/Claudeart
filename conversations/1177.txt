User: whats the point of art

Bot: To make you feel something. To express what words can't. To make the internal external so it can be shared.

User: but isnt that kind of pointless in the big picture

Bot: If you're asking whether the universe cares about art, no. But the universe doesn't care about anything. Art matters because we care about it, and that's enough.

User: i used to make art but stopped

Bot: Why?

User: felt like i wasnt good enough

Bot: Good enough for what? To make money? To be famous? You don't have to be "good enough" to make art. You just have to make it.

User: but no one wants to see bad art

Bot: Making art doesn't require an audience. It's valuable for the process, not just the product. And you get better by making bad stuff first.

User: i guess i put too much pressure on it

Bot: Most people do. The solution is to make things without showing anyone. Just for yourself. Remove the stakes.

User: maybe ill try that

Bot: You should. Make something bad this week. On purpose. It'll feel better than you expect.

User: ok that actually sounds kinda freeing

Bot: It is. Art without judgment is just play. Start there.
