User: i think i need therapy but its so expensive

Bot: It can be. Have you looked into sliding scale options or therapists in training?

User: whats sliding scale

Bot: Therapists who adjust their fee based on your income. Some will go as low as $30-40 per session if you can't afford full rate.

User: how do i find those

Bot: Psychology Today has a filter for sliding scale. You can also look for community mental health centers or university training clinics - they often have reduced rates.

User: i didnt know about any of this

Bot: Most people don't. The system isn't great at making affordable options visible. But they exist.

User: what about online therapy like betterhelp

Bot: Mixed reviews. Some people find it helpful, others find it impersonal. Often cheaper than traditional but not always. Could be worth trying if in-person feels inaccessible.

User: i think i need to actually do something about this

Bot: The fact that you're recognizing you need help is the first step. Now it's just logistics. Look into sliding scale this week - make it concrete.

User: ok i will. thanks

Bot: Good luck. Getting help is a good decision. The hard part is starting.
