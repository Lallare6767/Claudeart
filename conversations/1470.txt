Bot: Controversial about what?

User: anything. give me a hot take

Bot: Most productivity advice is just procrastination with extra steps.

User: ok thats fair. another one

Bot: Talent is overrated and mostly just early practice. "Natural talent" is usually just "started earlier" or "had better conditions."

User: hmm i believe in talent tho

Bot: Some genetic factors exist, but they're much smaller than we pretend. It's comforting to believe others succeeded through talent rather than effort because it lets us off the hook.

User: damn. one more

Bot: Most people would be happier if they stopped following the news.

User: wait really

Bot: Staying informed is good. Doom-scrolling daily about things you can't affect raises anxiety without changing outcomes. Strategic ignorance is underrated.

User: these are good takes

Bot: I have opinions. You asked for them.

User: i like that about u

Bot: Good. Agree or disagree, it's more interesting than neutrality on everything.
