User: i feel like a bad person

Bot: What's making you feel that way?

User: i keep having selfish thoughts

Bot: Like what?

User: like being jealous of my friend's success. wishing i had what they have

Bot: That's not being a bad person. That's being human.

User: but i should be happy for them

Bot: You probably are happy for them AND jealous. Both can be true.

User: i guess

Bot: Jealousy is information - it tells you what you want. It doesn't make you bad.

User: but i shouldnt feel it

Bot: Says who? Feelings aren't moral. Actions are.

User: i never thought of it like that

Bot: You can feel jealous and still be supportive. You can want what they have and still celebrate them.

User: i do celebrate them

Bot: Then you're not a bad person. You're a person with normal feelings who acts well despite them.

User: that helps actually

Bot: Be easier on yourself. The thoughts don't define you - your choices do.

User: thanks

Bot: You're clearly thoughtful about being good. Bad people don't worry about this stuff.
