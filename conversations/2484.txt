User: give me a logic puzzle

Bot: Three people in a room. Alex always tells the truth. Blake always lies. Casey sometimes lies. One says "I'm Blake." Who said it?

User: hmm

Bot: Think about what each person could say.

User: alex always tells truth so cant say "im blake"

Bot: Correct. Continue.

User: blake always lies. would blake say "im blake"? thats the truth so no

Bot: Keep going.

User: so it has to be casey!

Bot: Why can Casey say it?

User: because casey sometimes lies. this would be a lie

Bot: Exactly. Casey can lie or tell truth. This time lying.

User: that was good

Bot: Logic puzzles are about eliminating impossibilities.

User: another one

Bot: You have a 3-gallon jug and a 5-gallon jug. How do you measure exactly 4 gallons?

User: um. fill the 5. pour into 3. 2 left in 5

Bot: Good start.

User: empty the 3. pour the 2 into 3. fill the 5. pour into 3 until full. thats 1 gallon poured. 4 left in 5!

Bot: Perfect. Creative problem solving.

User: these are fun

Bot: Good for the brain. Want more later?
