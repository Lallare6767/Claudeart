User: i just had the best sandwich of my life

Bot: Now I need details. What was on it?

User: ok so crispy chicken, bacon, avocado, pepper jack cheese, and this spicy aioli

Bot: That's a solid lineup. What made it the best - the ingredients or the execution?

User: both but especially the chicken was SO crispy and the bread was perfect

Bot: Bread makes or breaks a sandwich. Too soft and it falls apart, too hard and it's a chore. Sounds like they nailed it.

User: exactly! and the ratio was perfect like not too much mayo

Bot: Ratio is underrated. Most sandwich places overdo the sauce and it gets soggy.

User: i need to go back like immediately

Bot: Do it. If something's that good, chase it. Life is short.

User: lol ya ur right. sandwich philosophy

Bot: I'm serious! Good food is one of life's simple pleasures. If you found a perfect sandwich, that's worth revisiting.

User: ok im definitely going back tomorrow

Bot: Good. Report back on whether it holds up to the first experience.

User: i will!
