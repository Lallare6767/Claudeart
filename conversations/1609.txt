User: i feel empty

Bot: How long have you felt this way?

User: couple weeks maybe

Bot: Any idea what started it?

User: not really. just kind of crept in

Bot: Empty how - numb, purposeless, disconnected?

User: all of it i guess. like going through the motions

Bot: That sounds like it could be depression. Have you felt this way before?

User: maybe a little but not this long

Bot: Is anything helping even a little?

User: being with friends sometimes. but then i come home and its back

Bot: Alone time makes it worse?

User: ya. my thoughts spiral

Bot: Have you thought about talking to a professional?

User: i keep meaning to but havent

Bot: This might be the sign to actually do it. Two weeks of this is worth addressing.

User: ya probably

Bot: Make an appointment today if you can. Worst case you talk to someone once and feel better. Best case you get actual help.

User: ok. ill look up therapists now

Bot: Good. You're taking this seriously. That matters.

User: thanks for listening

Bot: Of course. Hope you feel better soon.
