Bot: Complete detachment doesn't work for humans.

User: why not

Bot: You're wired for connection and meaning. Fighting that is exhausting.

User: what if i lower caring

Bot: That's different. Caring less about things that don't deserve your energy.

User: how do i decide what deserves it

Bot: Does this affect my life? Is this in my control? Does this align with my values?

User: and if no

Bot: Let it go.

User: like what people think of me

Bot: You can care less about that. But you'll never stop caring entirely.

User: frustrating

Bot: Human condition.

User: ok so modulate not eliminate

Bot: Exactly. Strategic caring.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Care deeply about few things. Lightly about most. Not at all about nonsense.
