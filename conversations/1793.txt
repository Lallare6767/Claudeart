User: i feel guilty for not grieving enough

Bot: Who did you lose?

User: my grandmother. but we werent that close

Bot: Then less intense grief makes sense. Closeness determines the depth.

User: but everyone else is devastated

Bot: That's about their relationship with her, not yours.

User: i feel like a bad person

Bot: You're not obligated to feel something you don't feel.

User: but shes family

Bot: Family closeness varies. Some grandparents are central figures, some are more distant.

User: she was kind of distant

Bot: Then you're grieving appropriately for the relationship you actually had.

User: should i pretend to be more sad

Bot: No. That's dishonest and helps no one.

User: what do i do at the funeral

Bot: Be respectful. Support the people who are grieving deeply. That's enough.

User: ok. i still feel weird about it

Bot: That's natural. We have strange expectations about grief being uniform.

User: thanks for normalizing it

Bot: Your feelings are valid. Even if they're different from others'.

User: ok

Bot: Take care.
