User: i feel like a burden

Bot: To whom?

User: everyone. friends. family. coworkers

Bot: What makes you feel that way?

User: i need help sometimes. i have bad days. i take up space

Bot: Those are normal human things.

User: but i dont want to bother people

Bot: Have they said you're a bother?

User: no

Bot: So this is your interpretation, not their statement.

User: i guess

Bot: People who love you want to help. That's what relationships are.

User: but i should be able to handle things myself

Bot: Why? Humans are interdependent.

User: i feel weak

Bot: Needing help isn't weakness. Refusing help is pride.

User: hm

Bot: Do you think others are burdens when they need help?

User: no

Bot: Double standard then.

User: yeah

Bot: You're allowed to take up space. You're allowed to need things.

User: ok

Bot: Ask for help when you need it. That's healthy, not burdensome.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You matter. Stop apologizing for existing.
