User: my neighbor is so loud i cant sleep

Bot: What kind of noise? Music, TV, footsteps?

User: everything. music at 1am, yelling, stomping around

Bot: Have you talked to them about it?

User: once. they said sorry and did it again the next night

Bot: Is there a landlord or building management?

User: ya but they say theyve talked to them and nothing changes

Bot: You might need to document it. Keep a log with dates, times, and type of noise.

User: for what

Bot: If it continues, you can escalate. Most leases have quiet hours clauses. Repeated violations can result in warnings or eviction.

User: i dont want to get them evicted

Bot: You also deserve to sleep. That's a basic need. You've tried talking nicely. The next step is reasonable.

User: i guess

Bot: Also consider: earplugs, white noise machine, moving your bed if possible. Can't hurt while you wait for them to stop.

User: ive been using a fan but it only helps a little

Bot: Keep documenting. After a week or two, go to management with your log. Patterns are harder to dismiss.

User: ok ill start keeping track

Bot: Your sleep matters. Don't feel guilty about protecting it.
