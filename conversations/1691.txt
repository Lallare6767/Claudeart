User: ugh i hate my voice

Bot: Most people hate the sound of their recorded voice. It's very common.

User: but mine is actually bad

Bot: What do you think is wrong with it?

User: its too high. and nasally

Bot: Have you gotten feedback from others or is this your own perception?

User: mostly my own i guess

Bot: People are usually much harder on their own voice than others are.

User: but when i hear recordings i cringe

Bot: That's because you normally hear your voice through bone conduction, which sounds deeper. Recordings show external sound waves.

User: so everyone goes through this?

Bot: Almost everyone. The recording is what others actually hear, and it takes getting used to.

User: does it get better

Bot: Yes. Voice actors and speakers get used to it through repeated exposure.

User: maybe i should record myself more

Bot: That's exactly how you get comfortable. Record, listen, repeat. The cringe fades.

User: seems painful lol

Bot: Temporarily. Worth it if your voice bothers you this much.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Your voice is fine. You're just not used to hearing it from outside.
