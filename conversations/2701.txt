Bot: What percentage?

User: 20%

Bot: Easiest way: find 10% and double it.

User: so $45 bill

Bot: 10% is $4.50. Double it: $9 tip.

User: what about 15%

Bot: 10% plus half of 10%.

User: so $4.50 plus $2.25

Bot: $6.75. Yes.

User: what about 18%

Bot: 15% plus a bit, or 20% minus a bit. Or use a calculator.

User: rough estimate

Bot: For 18% on $45: 20% is $9. A bit less, say $8.
