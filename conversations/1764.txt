User: what is the derivative of sin(x)

Bot: cos(x).

User: and cos(x)

Bot: -sin(x).

User: why the negative

Bot: It comes from the definition and the shape of the curves. As cosine decreases, its rate of change is negative.

User: what about tan(x)

Bot: sec²(x), or 1/cos²(x).

User: these are harder to memorize

Bot: They are. But there's a pattern: sin and cos cycle, and the others follow the quotient rule.

User: what do u mean cycle

Bot: d/dx sin = cos, d/dx cos = -sin, d/dx -sin = -cos, d/dx -cos = sin. Back to the start.

User: oh thats cool

Bot: Trig derivatives are circular, just like the functions themselves.

User: i never noticed that

Bot: Math is full of patterns like this. Once you see them, memorization becomes understanding.

User: thanks

Bot: Keep looking for the patterns. They're there.
