User: i want to learn guitar. where do i start

Bot: Get a guitar first. Acoustic is easier to start with - no amp needed. Used ones are fine for learning.

User: electric or acoustic

Bot: Acoustic. Builds finger strength, simpler setup, play anywhere. You can always add electric later.

User: ok then what

Bot: Learn a few basic chords: G, C, D, E minor. These four let you play hundreds of songs.

User: how do i learn them

Bot: YouTube tutorials are actually great for this. JustinGuitar is free and well-structured. Or get a few starter lessons from a teacher.

User: how long until i can play a song

Bot: You can play simple songs in a few weeks if you practice 20-30 minutes daily. Fingers will hurt at first but calluses build up.

User: thats faster than i thought

Bot: Playing well takes years. Playing recognizable songs takes weeks. Most people give up before they get over the initial hump.

User: whats the hump

Bot: Fingers hurt, chords sound bad, transitions are slow. After a month of consistency, all of that improves dramatically.

User: ok im gonna order a guitar tonight

Bot: Good. The best way to learn is to start. Don't overthink the "perfect" guitar - just get one and begin.
