Bot: Had you been looking for it?

User: no. was cleaning out a closet

Bot: When did he pass?

User: 5 years ago

Bot: How did finding it feel?

User: i just held it for a while. it still smells like him

Bot: Scent is the strongest memory trigger.

User: i didnt expect that

Bot: Five years and it still hits.

User: is that normal

Bot: Yes. Grief doesn't have an expiration date.

User: i thought id be more okay by now

Bot: You are okay. And you can still miss him. Both are true.

User: i dont want to lose the smell

Bot: Keep it somewhere protected. Seal it in a bag when not wearing.

User: i might wear it actually

Bot: That's a nice way to keep him close.

User: thanks

Bot: He'd probably like that you found it.
