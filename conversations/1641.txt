User: i want to learn to draw but i suck

Bot: Everyone sucks at first. That's what learning means.

User: but ive tried before and never got better

Bot: How long did you try?

User: a few weeks maybe

Bot: That's not enough time to see progress. Drawing takes months to years.

User: thats so long

Bot: Anything worth doing takes time. Were you practicing or just hoping?

User: what do u mean

Bot: Deliberate practice - specific skills, getting feedback, pushing uncomfortable areas. Or just drawing casually and hoping to improve?

User: probably the second one

Bot: That's why progress was slow. Casual drawing is fine for fun but doesn't build skill efficiently.

User: so what should i do

Bot: Pick one thing to practice - shading, proportions, hands. Do exercises targeting that. Look at tutorials. Compare your work to references.

User: that sounds harder

Bot: It is. But it actually works. "Draw every day" is too vague. "Practice hands from photo reference" is actionable.

User: ok. ill try hands first

Bot: Good choice - they're hard but improve a lot with practice. Track progress by saving early drawings.

User: ok. thanks for the reality check

Bot: You can do this. Just approach it as learning not wishing.
