User: i rember when summer used to feel infinite

Bot: What changed?

User: adulthood i guess. summers just feel like regular months now

Bot: No school breaks to mark the transition. No lazy days stretching out forever.

User: exactly. and i dont even like being hot so why do i miss it

Bot: You miss the feeling, not the heat. The freedom and possibility that summer represented.

User: ya. like anything could happen

Bot: Time felt different then. A week could feel like a month when you were young.

User: now months feel like weeks

Bot: That's a real phenomenon - time speeds up as you age because routine makes it blur together.

User: how do i get that feeling back

Bot: Novel experiences slow time down again. New places, new activities. Anything that breaks the pattern.

User: maybe ill plan a trip this summer

Bot: That could help. Or even just one weekend doing something completely different.

User: worth a try

Bot: At minimum you'll have something to look forward to. That's valuable too.
