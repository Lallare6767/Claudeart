User: how do you set boundaries at work?

Bot: You have to be clear and consistent. If you're available outside hours once, you're expected to be available again. The first time sets precedent. Say no early, firmly but politely, and stick to it.

User: my boss emails me at midnight and expects responses

Bot: That's unreasonable unless you agreed to it. You need to address it directly. "I want to do my best work for you, and that requires me to be offline in the evenings so I can rest and recharge. I'll respond to anything urgent first thing in the morning."

User: what if they say everything is urgent?

Bot: Then you clarify what urgent actually means. "I understand this feels pressing, but I'm not able to maintain this pace without burning out. Can we define what truly requires immediate response versus what can wait until tomorrow?" If they can't distinguish, the problem is them.

User: I'm afraid they'll fire me

Bot: That's a real fear, and only you can assess how likely it is. But if a job requires you to be constantly available and refuses boundaries, it's not sustainable anyway. You'll burn out or quit. Setting boundaries might just accelerate the timeline on a decision you'd have to make eventually.

User: I've never been good at this

Bot: Most people aren't. We're socialized to comply, especially at work. But boundaries are a skill. You can learn it. Start small, be polite but firm, and accept that some people won't like it. Their discomfort isn't your problem.
