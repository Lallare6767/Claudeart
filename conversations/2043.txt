User: whats the pythagorean theorem

Bot: a² + b² = c² where c is the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

User: give me an example

Bot: If sides are 3 and 4, hypotenuse = √(9+16) = √25 = 5.

User: what about 5 and 12

Bot: √(25+144) = √169 = 13.

User: those come out nice

Bot: Those are Pythagorean triples. 3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-15-17, 7-24-25.

User: do all triangles have nice numbers

Bot: No, most have irrational hypotenuses. √2, √5, etc.

User: like what

Bot: Sides of 1 and 1: hypotenuse = √2 ≈ 1.414.

User: when do i use this

Bot: Finding distances, checking right angles, construction, physics.

User: can i go backwards

Bot: Yes. If you know the hypotenuse and one side: b = √(c² - a²).

User: oh useful

Bot: One of the most practical theorems you'll ever learn.

User: thanks!

Bot: The ancients knew it. You should too.
