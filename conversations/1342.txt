User: if i make $50k a year how much is that per hour

Bot: Assuming 40 hours/week, 52 weeks:
$50,000 ÷ 2,080 = $24.04/hour

User: what about $75k

Bot: $75,000 ÷ 2,080 = $36.06/hour

User: and $100k

Bot: $100,000 ÷ 2,080 = $48.08/hour

User: so doubling salary doubles hourly rate

Bot: Yes, it's linear. The conversion factor is always the same (÷2,080 for a full-time year).

User: why is that useful to know

Bot: Helps you value your time. If you make $24/hour, spending 2 hours doing something you could pay $30 for doesn't make sense. Also helps compare hourly jobs to salary offers.

User: oh thats smart

Bot: Time is money is literally true. Knowing your hourly rate helps you make decisions.

User: i never thought about it that way

Bot: Most people don't. But it clarifies a lot of choices about what's worth your time.

User: ok thanks for the math perspective

Bot: Your time has value. Knowing what it is helps you spend it wisely.
