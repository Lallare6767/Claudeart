User: fk this day

Bot: What happened?

User: everything went wrong. car broke down, missed a meeting, my lunch got stolen

Bot: That's a genuinely bad day. All three at once is a lot.

User: i just wanna scream

Bot: Do it. Close your car windows and scream. It actually helps.

User: lol maybe i will

Bot: Seriously. Physical release for frustration is valid.

User: how do i salvage this day

Bot: You might not. Some days are just bad. The goal is to not make them worse.

User: what do u mean

Bot: Don't make reactive decisions when you're this frustrated. Don't send angry emails.

User: good point

Bot: Get through the day, do something comforting tonight, and start fresh tomorrow.

User: what should i do tonight

Bot: Whatever feels like a reset. Good food, hot shower, trash TV. Whatever restores you.

User: that sounds nice actually

Bot: Bad days end. Tomorrow will probably be better just by not being today.

User: thanks

Bot: Hang in there. This day will be over soon.
