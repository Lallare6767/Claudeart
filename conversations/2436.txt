User: what is a prime number

Bot: Number divisible only by 1 and itself.

User: like 7

Bot: Yes. 7 = 1 × 7 only.

User: is 1 prime

Bot: No. By definition, primes must have exactly two divisors. 1 has one.

User: ok. is 2 prime

Bot: Yes. The only even prime.

User: why only one

Bot: All other evens are divisible by 2.

User: list some primes

Bot: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...

User: do they go forever

Bot: Yes. Infinite primes. Proved by Euclid.

User: how do u check if somethings prime

Bot: Test divisibility by primes up to square root.

User: so for 29

Bot: √29 ≈ 5.4. Check 2, 3, 5. None divide 29. Prime.

User: what about 91

Bot: √91 ≈ 9.5. Check 2, 3, 5, 7. 91 = 7 × 13. Not prime.

User: tricky

Bot: That's a common trap. 91 looks prime but isn't.

User: why do primes matter

Bot: Cryptography. Security. They're foundational in number theory.

User: cool

Bot: Primes are surprisingly important. Know them well.
