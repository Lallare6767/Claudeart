User: how do negative exponents work

Bot: A negative exponent means reciprocal.

User: what

Bot: x^(-n) = 1/(x^n)

User: example

Bot: 2^(-3) = 1/(2^3) = 1/8.

User: so the negative flips it

Bot: Exactly. Moves it to the denominator.

User: what about 5^(-2)

Bot: 1/(5^2) = 1/25.

User: ok what about something like (1/2)^(-1)

Bot: That's 1 divided by (1/2), which is 2.

User: the negative flips the fraction

Bot: Yes. (a/b)^(-1) = b/a.

User: what about (1/3)^(-2)

Bot: That's (3/1)^2 = 9.

User: ok i think i get it

Bot: Negative exponent = flip it. Then apply positive exponent.

User: that helps thanks

Bot: Practice a few more and it'll click completely.
