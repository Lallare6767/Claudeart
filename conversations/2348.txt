User: i hate my body

Bot: What specifically?

User: everything. how it looks. how it feels

Bot: Has it always been this way?

User: as long as i remember

Bot: Where did it start?

User: comments when i was young. comparisons

Bot: Other people's words became your inner voice.

User: yeah

Bot: Your body does a lot for you that has nothing to do with appearance.

User: i know but i still hate looking at it

Bot: That's about learned perception, not the body itself.

User: can that change

Bot: With work, yes. Body image is malleable.

User: how

Bot: Therapy helps. Especially if it's been lifelong.

User: anything else

Bot: Gratitude practice for function. "My legs carried me today." Shifts focus.

User: feels fake

Bot: At first. But it builds a different relationship with your body.

User: ok

Bot: You deserve to feel at home in your body. It's possible.

User: thanks

Bot: Consider professional help. You don't have to live this way.
