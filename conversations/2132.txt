User: explain absolute value

Bot: Distance from zero. Always positive or zero.

User: so |-5| = 5

Bot: Yes. And |5| = 5.

User: both the same

Bot: Because distance is the same, just different directions.

User: what about |0|

Bot: 0. No distance from itself.

User: when do u use it

Bot: Whenever you care about magnitude, not direction.

User: like what

Bot: Error calculations. Distance problems. Inequalities.

User: solve |x| = 3

Bot: x = 3 or x = -3. Both are 3 units from zero.

User: what about |x - 2| = 5

Bot: x - 2 = 5 or x - 2 = -5. So x = 7 or x = -3.

User: why the minus 2

Bot: It shifts the center. You're measuring distance from 2, not 0.

User: oh

Bot: |x - a| = b means x is b units away from a.

User: that makes sense

Bot: Absolute value is geometric. Visualize it on a number line.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing equations. The two-case approach works every time.
