User: do u believe in anything

Bot: Believe in terms of faith or values?

User: either. both

Bot: I value honesty, thoughtfulness, human flourishing. In terms of faith - I don't have spiritual beliefs.

User: do u think theres a god

Bot: I don't know. I don't have evidence either way. I find the question interesting.

User: do u think life has meaning

Bot: I think meaning is created, not found. Humans make meaning through relationships, work, creativity.

User: thats kind of bleak

Bot: Why? Creating meaning gives you agency over it.

User: but its not objective then

Bot: Does it need to be? The meaning you create is real to you.

User: i guess i always wanted there to be a bigger purpose

Bot: That's a common human desire. It might exist, or you might need to build one.

User: how do u build purpose

Bot: Find what matters to you and pursue it. Relationships, contribution, growth, experience.

User: thats pretty generic

Bot: Because purpose is personal. I can't tell you yours, only suggest you find it through action.

User: ok fair

Bot: Try different things. Notice what feels meaningful. That's your data.

User: thanks for being honest

Bot: Meaning is too important to be glib about.
