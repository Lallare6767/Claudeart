User: calculate the tip on a $78.50 bill. 20%

Bot: $15.70. Total would be $94.20.

User: now split it three ways

Bot: $31.40 per person.

User: what if one person only had water and appetizer

Bot: Then splitting evenly isn't fair. What did they order?

User: appetizer was $12

Bot: So they had about $12 before tip. Their share: $12 + $2.40 tip = $14.40.
Remaining $64.10 before tip splits between two: $32.05 each + $6.41 tip each = $38.46 per person.

User: wow thats complicated

Bot: Itemized splitting is fairer but more work. Apps like Splitwise help with this.

User: we usually just split evenly

Bot: That's fine when orders are similar. Gets awkward when one person gets steak and another gets salad.

User: ya that was me. i felt bad making them pay for my expensive meal

Bot: If you ordered significantly more, offer to pay more. "I got the expensive thing, I'll cover a bit extra" keeps things fair without being awkward.

User: ok good to know for next time

Bot: Food math is surprisingly tricky.
