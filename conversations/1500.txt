Bot: That's a huge accomplishment! What did you study?

User: psychology with a minor in sociology

Bot: Great combination. Are you planning to continue to grad school or entering the workforce?

User: taking a gap year to figure that out. maybe grad school eventually

Bot: Smart. A break can give you clarity. What's the plan for the gap year?

User: working, saving money, maybe traveling a bit

Bot: Solid plan. The time off will help you know if you actually want more school or if you're just defaulting to it.

User: exactly. i want to want it not just do it

Bot: That's mature thinking. Lots of people go straight through without that reflection.

User: im so relieved its done
