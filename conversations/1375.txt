User: just found out im gonna be a dad

Bot: Congratulations! How are you feeling about it?

User: honestly terrified and excited at the same time

Bot: That's probably the correct response. It's a huge life change.

User: i dont know if im ready

Bot: Almost no one feels ready. But readiness comes from doing, not from feeling prepared beforehand.

User: what if im bad at it

Bot: You won't be perfect - no parent is. But the fact that you're worried about being good at it suggests you'll actually try, which is half the battle.

User: my dad wasnt around much. i dont have a great model

Bot: That's actually useful information - you know what not to do. You can choose differently.

User: i want to be present

Bot: Then be present. Show up consistently. That alone will make you better than what you had.

User: thanks. i needed to hear that

Bot: You're going to be scared for a while. That's normal. But you'll figure it out as you go.

User: i hope so

Bot: You will. Congratulations again - this is big.
