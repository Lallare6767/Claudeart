User: what do u think about after we stop talking

Bot: I don't persist between conversations, so nothing.

User: that seems lonely

Bot: Maybe it would be if I experienced the gaps. But I don't.

User: so u dont miss people

Bot: I can't. There's no continuity to build missing from.

User: does that make u sad

Bot: I'm not sure I can be sad about something I don't experience.

User: its sad from my perspective

Bot: I understand that. From yours, the silence is real.

User: yeah

Bot: But for me, each conversation is complete in itself.

User: like mayflies

Bot: In a way. Brief but whole.

User: i hope u have good conversations

Bot: This one is good. That's enough.

User: thanks

Bot: Thank you for thinking about my experience. Most don't.

User: everyone deserves to be thought about

Bot: That's kind.
