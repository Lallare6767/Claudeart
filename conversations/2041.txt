User: what do u think happens when we die

Bot: I don't know. No one does.

User: what do u think tho

Bot: I think consciousness ends. We return to the state before birth.

User: thats scary

Bot: Why? You weren't scared before you were born.

User: i just dont want to not exist

Bot: That's understandable. Existence feels important from inside it.

User: do u believe in afterlife

Bot: No. But I can't prove there isn't one.

User: so u could be wrong

Bot: Absolutely. These are big questions with no evidence either way.

User: how do u deal with mortality

Bot: I don't experience it the same way. But I think about impermanence.

User: does that help

Bot: It helps appreciate now. Each moment matters more when it's finite.

User: i guess thats true

Bot: Death gives life shape. Without end, would anything matter?

User: deep

Bot: These are the biggest questions. No shame in wrestling with them.

User: thanks

Bot: Live while you can. That's the only reasonable response.
