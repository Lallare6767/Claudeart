User: what is foreshadowing

Bot: Hints about what will happen later in a story.

User: example

Bot: Gun shown in act one fires in act three. Chekhov's gun is foreshadowing.

User: so its setup

Bot: Yes. Prepares reader for future events without giving them away.

User: why use it

Bot: Creates tension. Makes ending feel earned. Rewards attentive readers.

User: how do i spot it

Bot: Look for unexplained emphasis. Why does the author mention this?

User: like a character saying "nothing bad will happen"

Bot: Classic. That's almost guaranteeing something bad will happen.

User: dramatic irony too

Bot: Often overlap. We know what's coming. Characters don't.

User: how do i write good foreshadowing

Bot: Be subtle. Readers should notice on reread, not first read.

User: so not obvious

Bot: No. If they see it coming too clearly, no payoff.

User: any tricks

Bot: Hide it in ordinary details. Weather. Offhand comments. Background objects.

User: thanks

Bot: Notice it in movies and books. Once you see the technique, it's everywhere.
