User: how do u handle criticism

Bot: I try to separate valid criticism from attack. If someone says I'm wrong about something factual, I check it. If someone says I'm useless because they're frustrated, I don't take that personally.

User: thats healthy

Bot: It took practice. The instinct is to defend or counter-attack. But that's rarely useful.

User: i get really defensive when criticized

Bot: What does defensive look like for you - arguing back, shutting down, deflecting?

User: all of it depending on the day

Bot: The common thread is protecting yourself from feeling bad. But the criticism doesn't go away just because you reject it.

User: so what do i do instead

Bot: Pause before responding. Ask yourself: is there truth here? Even if only 10%, that's worth hearing. You can disagree with how they said it while still learning from what they said.

User: what if theyre just being mean

Bot: Then you can dismiss it. But most criticism has some kernel worth extracting. Even mean criticism sometimes points at real blind spots.

User: ok that makes sense

Bot: Getting better at hearing criticism is a superpower. Most people can't do it.
