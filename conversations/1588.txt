User: am i too old to change careers

Bot: How old are you?

User: 38

Bot: No. People change careers in their 40s, 50s, even 60s. You have decades of work left.

User: but ill be starting over

Bot: Starting over with experience. You're not 22 - you have transferable skills.

User: like what

Bot: Communication, problem-solving, managing people or projects, understanding professional norms. Those apply everywhere.

User: but id be entry level in the new field

Bot: Maybe. Or maybe adjacent roles that value your experience. What are you thinking of switching to?

User: tech. maybe product management

Bot: Product management actually favors people with domain experience in other fields. Your background could be an asset.

User: really?

Bot: Yes. Companies need PMs who understand real industries. "Just started over" might actually be "brought valuable perspective."

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: Reframe the switch as an addition not a reset. You're adding tech skills to existing ones.

User: ok that helps

Bot: You're not too old. You might be exactly what companies need.

User: thanks. ill look into programs

Bot: Good luck. This is doable.
