Bot: What happened?

User: told my secret to other people

Bot: What kind of secret?

User: personal. about my mental health

Bot: That's a serious breach. Have you confronted them?

User: not yet. im so angry

Bot: Understandably. How did you find out?

User: someone else told me they heard

Bot: So it's definitely spread.

User: yes

Bot: Do you want to save the friendship?

User: i dont know. maybe. we've been friends for 10 years

Bot: Then you need to have a direct conversation.

User: what if they deny it

Bot: Then you have your answer about who they are.

User: i trusted them

Bot: I know. That's why it hurts so much.

User: it really does

Bot: Trust broken this way is hard to rebuild. But not impossible if they take responsibility.
