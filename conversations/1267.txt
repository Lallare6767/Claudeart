User: im nervous about getting a dog

Bot: Nervous about what specifically?

User: like the commitment. 10-15 years is a long time

Bot: It is. But also - you'll be alive for those 10-15 years either way. The dog just makes them better.

User: what if im not good at it

Bot: You'll learn. Nobody knows how to take care of a dog until they have one. The basics are: feed them, walk them, love them. It's not that complicated.

User: what about vet bills

Bot: They can be expensive. Budget for regular checkups and have emergency funds. Pet insurance is an option if you want to reduce risk.

User: i travel sometimes too

Bot: Then you need a plan - boarding, pet sitters, friends who can dog-sit. It's manageable but you have to think about it.

User: am i too selfish for a dog

Bot: The fact that you're asking suggests not. Selfish people don't worry about being selfish. You're considering the commitment seriously, which is the right approach.

User: i really want one tho

Bot: Then get one. You've thought about it, you know the downsides, you're still drawn to it. That's a good sign. The commitment is real but so is the reward.

User: ok maybe ill start looking

Bot: Good luck. Dogs change your life in mostly good ways.
