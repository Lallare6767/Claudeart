User: my coworker keeps stealing my ideas

Bot: In meetings?

User: yeah they wait til i say something then reframe it as theirs

Bot: Classic move. Annoying and effective.

User: what do i do

Bot: Start documenting. Email your ideas to your boss before meetings.

User: wont that seem weird

Bot: Frame it as "wanted to share some thoughts before tomorrow's meeting."

User: ok what else

Bot: In meetings, when they reframe your idea, say "Yes, exactly what I was suggesting."

User: reclaim it

Bot: Firmly but professionally.

User: what if my boss doesnt notice

Bot: That email trail you're building will make it clear whose ideas they are.

User: this is so frustrating

Bot: It is. Some people climb by standing on others.

User: ok ill try this

Bot: Protect your work. No one else will do it for you.
