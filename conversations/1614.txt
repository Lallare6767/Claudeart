User: i have to fire someone and i feel terrible

Bot: That's a hard responsibility. What's the reason?

User: performance issues. weve done multiple conversations and improvement plans

Bot: So this isn't a surprise to them?

User: no. theyve been warned

Bot: That makes it less cruel at least. You did the process right.

User: but i still feel bad. they have bills and stuff

Bot: Of course you do. You're human. But keeping them doesn't help either of you.

User: what do i say

Bot: Be direct and compassionate. "We've discussed the performance issues and the improvements haven't been enough. We're ending your employment effective [date]."

User: then what

Bot: Explain next steps - severance, benefits, returning equipment. Have HR details ready.

User: what if they get angry or cry

Bot: Let them react. Give them space. Have tissues. Don't over-explain or justify - it comes across as defensive.

User: this is the worst part of management

Bot: It really is. But it's necessary sometimes. The team is affected by underperformers too.

User: i know. just hard

Bot: It should be hard. If it were easy you'd be doing it wrong.

User: ok. thanks for talking me through it

Bot: You've got this. It'll be over soon and you'll both move on.
