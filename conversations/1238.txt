User: help im overthinking again

Bot: About what?

User: a text i sent earlier that i think came off wrong

Bot: How long ago?

User: like 4 hours

Bot: And you've been thinking about it that whole time?

User: on and off ya

Bot: Here's the reality: the person has probably not thought about it at all. They read it, moved on, and are doing other things.

User: but what if they didnt

Bot: Then what? You can't unsend it. You can't control their interpretation. Worrying about it changes nothing except your own mental state.

User: but what if they think im weird now

Bot: Then they do and life goes on. But they probably don't. People are much less focused on us than we think.

User: i know this logically

Bot: Knowing and feeling are different. When the thought comes, notice it and redirect. "I'm overthinking again" and then literally do something else. Don't engage with the spiral.

User: its hard to stop

Bot: It is. But you can get better at not feeding it. The thought will pass faster if you don't give it attention.

User: ok ill try to let it go

Bot: Good. And for what it's worth - the text was probably fine.
