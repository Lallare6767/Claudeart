User: i need help writing a resignation letter

Bot: How formal is your workplace and are you leaving on good terms?

User: pretty formal and yes good terms

Bot: Here's a standard format:

"Dear [Manager's name],

I am writing to inform you of my resignation from my position as [Title] at [Company], effective [Date - typically two weeks out].

I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had here and proud of the work we've accomplished. I'm committed to ensuring a smooth transition and am happy to help train my replacement during my remaining time.

Thank you for the support and guidance during my tenure. I wish the team continued success.

Sincerely,
[Your name]"

User: can u make it less formal but still professional

Bot: "Hi [Manager],

I wanted to let you know I'll be resigning from my role, effective [Date].

I've really valued my time here and appreciate everything I've learned. I'll do whatever I can to make the transition smooth - happy to help train whoever takes over.

Thanks for everything.

[Name]"

User: perfect. thanks

Bot: Good luck with the next chapter. Leave graciously even if you don't have to - it pays off later.
