User: how do you divide fractions

Bot: Flip the second fraction and multiply.

User: flip?

Bot: Reciprocal. 3/4 becomes 4/3.

User: example

Bot: 1/2 ÷ 3/4. Flip second: 1/2 × 4/3 = 4/6 = 2/3.

User: why does flipping work

Bot: Dividing by a fraction is multiplying by how many times it fits.

User: kinda makes sense

Bot: Just memorize: keep, change, flip.

User: keep first fraction, change to multiply, flip second

Bot: Exactly.

User: another example

Bot: 5/6 ÷ 2/3. Becomes 5/6 × 3/2 = 15/12 = 5/4.

User: thats improper

Bot: Yes. 5/4 = 1 and 1/4.

User: got it

Bot: Division of fractions trips people up. But its just multiplication in disguise.
