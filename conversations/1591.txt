User: help me write a cold email to someone in my industry

Bot: Sure. What's your goal and who's the person?

User: informational interview. theyre a creative director at an agency i admire

Bot: Good goal. Keep it short and specific. Here's a framework:

"Subject: Quick question about your path to Creative Director

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your name], a [your role] at [company] who's been following [their agency's] work, especially [specific project].

I'm working toward a creative director role and would love to learn about your path. Would you have 20 minutes for a brief call or coffee?

I know you're busy so I'll keep it focused. If not, I completely understand.

Thanks,
[Your name]"

User: is 20 minutes enough

Bot: Yes. Ask for less than you want. If they say yes and conversation flows, it'll go longer.

User: should i explain why them specifically

Bot: The specific project mention does that. Shows you're not mass emailing.

User: what if they dont respond

Bot: Follow up once after a week. If nothing, move on. Don't take it personally - busy people miss emails.

User: ok this helps. thanks

Bot: Good luck! Cold outreach works more often than people think.
