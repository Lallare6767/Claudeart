User: i cant stop thinking about embarassing things i did years ago

Bot: Those 3am flashbacks? Everyone has them. The brain loves replaying cringe moments for some reason.

User: why does it do that

Bot: A few theories: your brain is trying to learn from social mistakes, or it's processing unresolved emotions, or it's just a glitch in memory retrieval. Either way, it's common and it's annoying.

User: how do i make it stop

Bot: You can't fully eliminate it, but you can reduce its power. When the memory hits, remind yourself: nobody else remembers this. And if they do, they're not thinking about it.

User: but what if they do remember

Bot: Then they have their own 3am moments about their own stuff. Nobody is lying awake thinking about your embarrassing moment from 2015.

User: i guess thats true

Bot: It is. You're the main character of your own life, not theirs. They're too busy cringing at their own memories to catalog yours.

User: that actually helps

Bot: Next time it happens, notice it, acknowledge "brain is doing the cringe thing," and redirect. Don't engage with the memory - just let it pass.

User: ok ill try that

Bot: It takes practice but it works. The memories don't deserve the attention you're giving them.
