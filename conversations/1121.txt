User: whats the point of anything

Bot: Big question. What's prompting it?

User: i just feel like nothing matters sometimes

Bot: Is this general philosophical wondering or are you actually feeling hopeless?

User: maybe both

Bot: Okay. On the philosophy: nothing has inherent cosmic meaning, but things matter to you - that's enough. Your experience is real even if the universe doesn't care about it.

User: but why bother

Bot: Because you're here and you're going to experience something either way. Might as well try to make it good.

User: that feels kinda hollow

Bot: It can feel that way when you're in the emptiness. Are you okay? Like actually okay?

User: idk. probably not

Bot: Have you talked to anyone about this? A therapist or someone you trust?

User: no

Bot: You should. These thoughts are common but when they stick around, they need attention. This is beyond what I can help with properly.

User: ya maybe ur right

Bot: Please reach out to someone. A professional, a friend, a crisis line if you need it. You don't have to figure this out alone.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Take care of yourself. You matter even if it doesn't feel that way right now.
