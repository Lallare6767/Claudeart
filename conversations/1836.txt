User: help me decide between two apartments

Bot: Tell me about them.

User: one is bigger and cheaper but further from work. other is small and expensive but close

Bot: How much further?

User: 40 min commute vs 10 min

Bot: So 60 extra minutes daily. That's 5 hours a week, 260 hours a year.

User: damn when u put it like that

Bot: What's the rent difference?

User: $400 a month

Bot: Is your time worth $400 a month? 260 hours / 12 = about 21 hours. That's roughly $20/hour for your time back.

User: i make more than that

Bot: Then mathematically, the closer one makes sense.

User: but its so small

Bot: How much time will you spend in it vs commuting?

User: probably just sleeping and some evenings

Bot: Then size matters less than you think.

User: ok im leaning toward the closer one

Bot: Commute time compounds stress and eats your life. Smaller space is livable.

User: thanks for helping me think it through

Bot: Trust the math. Your time is valuable.
