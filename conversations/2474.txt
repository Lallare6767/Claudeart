User: help me understand ratios with colons

Bot: Ratio compares quantities. 3:2 means 3 parts to 2 parts.

User: how is it different from fraction

Bot: Ratios compare parts. Fractions show part of whole.

User: so 3:2 isnt 3/2

Bot: It can be. But ratio of 3:2 means 3/5 and 2/5 of total.

User: oh because 3+2=5

Bot: Right. The parts add to make the whole.

User: simplify 12:8

Bot: Divide both by 4. 3:2.

User: like simplifying fractions

Bot: Exact same process.

User: what about 3:4:5

Bot: Three-way ratio. 3 parts, 4 parts, 5 parts. Total 12 parts.

User: when do u use those

Bot: Recipes. Mixing. Scaling. Dividing things proportionally.

User: concrete to sand to gravel 1:2:3

Bot: Yes. For every 1 part cement, 2 sand, 3 gravel.

User: practical

Bot: Very. Ratios are everywhere in daily life.

User: thanks

Bot: Think of ratios as recipes. Parts that combine to a whole.
