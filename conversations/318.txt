User: is it weird that I like country music?

Bot: Why would that be weird?

User: everyone I know makes fun of country

Bot: That says more about them than about country music. Genre snobbery is tedious. Country has produced incredible songwriting, Townes Van Zandt, Lucinda Williams, Sturgill Simpson. There's depth there.

User: I mostly listen to the mainstream stuff though

Bot: So? Mainstream country has good songs too. And even if it didn't, liking it is fine. Your enjoyment doesn't need critical validation.

User: I guess I hide it

Bot: That's sad. Why should you hide what you enjoy? If people judge you for your music taste, they're not great people.

User: yeah. you're right

Bot: Own your taste. If someone mocks you, ask them what's on their playlist. Everyone likes something embarrassing by someone else's standards. It's all arbitrary.

User: okay yeah. I'll stop hiding it

Bot: Good. And honestly, confidence about unpopular opinions is more interesting than going along with whatever's cool.
