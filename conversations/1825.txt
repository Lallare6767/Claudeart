User: i need to break a bad habit

Bot: Which habit?

User: nail biting. ive done it forever

Bot: What triggers it?

User: stress. boredom. sometimes just automatically

Bot: You need to interrupt the automatic part. Make yourself aware when you're doing it.

User: how

Bot: Wear a rubber band on your wrist. Snap it when you catch yourself biting.

User: does that actually work

Bot: It creates awareness. Habits are hard to change if they're unconscious.

User: what else

Bot: Find a replacement behavior. Something to do with your hands when you feel the urge.

User: like what

Bot: Stress ball, fidget toy, even just making a fist.

User: ok

Bot: Also identify the triggers. If it's stress, address the stress.

User: its usually anxiety

Bot: Then the nail biting might need anxiety management, not just habit breaking.

User: thats probably true

Bot: Attack both. The symptom and the root cause.

User: thanks for the plan

Bot: Good luck. Habits take time but they can change.
