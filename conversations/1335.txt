User: calculate tip for me: bill is $67.50 and i want to leave 18%

Bot: $67.50 × 0.18 = $12.15

Total would be $79.65.

User: now 20%

Bot: $67.50 × 0.20 = $13.50

Total: $81.00

User: how do i do that quickly in my head

Bot: For 20%: move the decimal left one place (10%) and double it.
$67.50 → $6.75 → $13.50

For 18%: start with 20% and subtract a bit. Or do 10% + 8%.

User: whats 10% plus 8%

Bot: $6.75 + $5.40 = $12.15

To get 8%: take 10% ($6.75), subtract 20% of that ($1.35).

User: that seems complicated

Bot: The 20% method is simplest. Do 20% and round. Nobody will notice a few cents difference.

User: ya ill just do that

Bot: Mental math for tips is about speed, not precision. Getting close is good enough.

User: thanks. i always pull out my phone

Bot: Nothing wrong with that either. But nice to do it in your head sometimes.
