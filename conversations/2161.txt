User: write something about endings

Bot: Every ending carries a ghost of what came before. We mourn what was while standing in what will be. The space between is where we grow.

User: thats nice

Bot: Thanks. Want more?

User: yes

Bot: An ending isn't the absence of what was. It's the presence of what's next, still formless. Grief is just love adjusting its shape.
