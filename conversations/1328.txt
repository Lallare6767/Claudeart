User: do u believe in soulmates

Bot: I think strong connections are real but the "one perfect person" idea is a myth. There are many people you could have a great relationship with. Finding one is about compatibility, timing, and work, not fate.

User: thats less romantic

Bot: Maybe. But it's also more hopeful - you're not dependent on finding one specific person in 8 billion. There are many potential good matches.

User: what about that feeling of "knowing"

Bot: That feeling is real but it's not magic. It's recognizing compatibility quickly. Some people click immediately. But instant feeling doesn't guarantee long-term success.

User: so it doesnt matter if u feel it

Bot: It matters, but it's not sufficient. The feeling gets you started. The work keeps you together.

User: i think i romanticize relationships too much

Bot: A lot of people do. Movies don't show the maintenance part. Real relationships are daily choices, not just big moments.

User: so what should i look for

Bot: Someone who's compatible with your values and lifestyle, treats you well, communicates, and is willing to work at it. That's more reliable than "the one."

User: ok thats practical

Bot: Romance is nice but it's not the foundation. Practical compatibility is. The romance can build on top of that.

User: thanks for the perspective

Bot: Good luck out there.
