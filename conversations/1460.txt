User: how do i deal with a passive aggressive coworker

Bot: What are they doing specifically?

User: giving backhanded compliments, "forgetting" to include me on emails, sighing loudly when i talk in meetings

Bot: Classic passive aggression. Have they said anything directly about a problem?

User: no which is the frustrating part

Bot: The point of passive aggression is to express hostility without being confrontable. It's plausible deniability.

User: so what do i do

Bot: You can name it directly but gently. "I noticed I wasn't on that email chain - can you add me?" No accusation, just fact.

User: what about the sighing

Bot: Harder to address. You can ask privately: "I've noticed some tension. Is there something we should discuss?" Forces them to either speak up or deny it.

User: what if they deny it

Bot: Then you've documented that you tried. And sometimes just naming it makes it decrease because they know you see it.

User: should i go to my manager

Bot: Not yet. Try direct communication first. If the behavior continues and affects your work, then escalate with examples.

User: ok. this is so annoying

Bot: It is. Passive aggression is hard because you can't fight something that denies its own existence.
