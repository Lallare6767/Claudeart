User: im thinking about going back to school

Bot: For what and why?

User: masters in data science. i want to switch careers

Bot: Is a masters actually required for data science roles in your area? Or could you learn the skills other ways?

User: i dont know actually

Bot: Check job postings. See what they actually require vs what's "preferred." A masters is 2 years and $50k+. Make sure you need it.

User: ya thats a good point

Bot: Alternative paths: bootcamps, self-study with portfolio projects, certifications. All cheaper and faster. Less prestige but potentially enough.

User: but wont the degree look better

Bot: Maybe. But experience and demonstrated skills often matter more in tech. If you can show you know the work, many employers don't care how you learned it.

User: so u think i shouldnt do it

Bot: I think you should investigate before assuming it's the path. Talk to people in data science roles. Ask what they actually value in candidates.

User: ok thats fair. ill do some research

Bot: Good. It might be the right choice, but make it with information, not assumption.

User: thanks for not just telling me what i wanted to hear

Bot: That's kind of my thing.
