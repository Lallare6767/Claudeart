User: i just realized i dont like who i am when im with certain ppl

Bot: That's an important realization. Who brings out a version of you that you don't like?

User: a group of friends from college. i get mean and gossipy

Bot: What triggers that behavior?

User: i dont know. maybe im trying to fit in

Bot: You're mirroring them to belong.

User: yeah probably

Bot: The question is: is fitting in with them worth being someone you don't like?

User: when u put it like that no

Bot: You have a few options. Distance yourself, try to change the dynamic, or change how you show up.

User: can i change the dynamic

Bot: Maybe. But groups have momentum. One person changing often doesn't shift the whole culture.

User: so i should distance myself

Bot: Or accept that you'll be the "unfun" one who doesn't participate in the gossip.

User: that sounds lonely

Bot: Less lonely than betraying yourself every time you hang out.

User: ouch

Bot: You asked. The best option is probably finding people who bring out the version of you that you like.

User: ur right

Bot: The company you keep shapes who you become. Choose wisely.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck with this. It's a hard one.
