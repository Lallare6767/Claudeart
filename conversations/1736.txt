User: if i flip a coin 3 times whats the chance of getting all heads

Bot: 1/8 or 12.5%.

User: why

Bot: Each flip is 1/2. Three flips: 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8.

User: what about at least 2 heads

Bot: 4/8 or 50%.

User: show me

Bot: Possible outcomes: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT. Four of those have at least 2 heads.

User: oh so u count all the possibilities

Bot: Yes. For small numbers, listing them all works. For larger, you use formulas.

User: what formula

Bot: Combinations: C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). For 2 heads in 3 flips: C(3,2) = 3.

User: thats confusing

Bot: For now, just list outcomes when possible. The formula is for when listing isn't practical.

User: ok

Bot: Probability is about counting favorable outcomes over total outcomes. That's the core concept.

User: that helps

Bot: Keep practicing. It becomes intuitive.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck with probability.
