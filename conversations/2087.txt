User: but what do i write about

Bot: Whatever's in your head. Dump it out.

User: what if its boring

Bot: It's for you, not readers. Boring is fine.

User: prompts?

Bot: You can use them. "What am I feeling right now?" "What went well today?"

User: how often

Bot: Whatever you can maintain. Daily is ideal. Weekly is fine.

User: morning or night

Bot: Night for processing the day. Morning for intentions.

User: how long

Bot: Even 5 minutes helps. Quality over quantity.

User: do i need to keep them

Bot: Your choice. Some people burn them. The act of writing is the value.

User: digital or paper

User: ok

Bot: No pressure to be deep. Just write.

User: thanks
