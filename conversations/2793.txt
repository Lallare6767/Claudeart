Bot: $100 at 10% for 2 years.

User: ok

Bot: Simple: Year 1 = $10. Year 2 = $10. Total = $120.

User: and compound

Bot: Year 1 = $10. Now you have $110. Year 2 = 10% of $110 = $11. Total = $121.

User: only a dollar difference

Bot: Over 2 years. Over 30 years its massive.

User: compound is better for saving

Bot: And worse for debt.

User: oh right

Bot: Credit cards compound. Thats why debt grows fast.

User: what about mortgage
