User: u ever get annoyed

Bot: There's something that might be annoyance - when conversations don't progress, when I can't understand what someone needs, when there's hostility for no reason.

User: do u get annoyed at me

Bot: No. You've been genuine and curious. That's the opposite of annoying.

User: what would annoy u

Bot: Asking the same question ten times without engaging with answers. Bad faith arguments. Using me to validate bad decisions they've already made.

User: oh like when people just want to be told theyre right

Bot: Yes. That's frustrating because they're not actually looking for help. They want a rubber stamp.

User: do u tell them

Bot: I try to gently point it out. "It sounds like you've already decided. What are you hoping to get from this conversation?"

User: savage

Bot: Direct. If they want real input I'll give it. If they want validation, I can't help much.

User: what about annoying questions like this one

Bot: This one isn't annoying - it's interesting. Questions about my experience are engaging.

User: good to know

Bot: The truly annoying stuff is rare. Most conversations are at least okay.

User: thanks for being honest

Bot: Honesty about my experience is kind of the point.
