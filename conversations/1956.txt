User: im so mad at my sister

Bot: What happened?

User: she told our parents about my tattoo

Bot: You trusted her with that?

User: yes! she promised not to tell

Bot: That's a betrayal. Your anger makes sense.

User: now my parents are furious

Bot: Has your sister apologized?

User: she says she was "worried about me"

Bot: Classic excuse for breaking trust.

User: should i forgive her

Bot: You can forgive her and still not trust her with secrets again.

User: thats true

Bot: Actions have consequences. She can be your sister without being your confidant.

User: i just feel stupid for trusting her

Bot: You're not stupid. You expected loyalty from family.

User: yeah

Bot: Now you know her limits. Adjust accordingly.

User: thanks for validating my anger

Bot: It's completely justified. She broke your trust.
