User: how do you avoid being an obnoxious tourist?

Bot: Learn some basic phrases in the local language. Don't be loud. Ask before taking photos of people. Don't haggle aggressively in places where that's not the norm. Be patient with customs you don't understand. Basically, treat the place and its people with respect rather than as a backdrop for your vacation.

User: anything else?

Bot: Eat local. Don't just go to places that serve food adapted for tourists. Venture off the main streets. If a restaurant has a menu in ten languages, it's probably not where locals eat.

User: what about tipping and stuff?

Bot: Research local customs before you go. Tipping is expected in the US, sometimes insulting in Japan, optional but appreciated in Europe. Getting it wrong isn't the worst thing but it helps to know.

User: I worry about offending people without knowing

Bot: You'll probably make some mistakes. Most people are forgiving if your intent is good. The effort to understand matters. Arrogance and entitlement are what people object to, not honest ignorance.

User: any places tourists should just avoid?

Bot: I'd say avoid places that are only visited by tourists and exist only to separate tourists from money. They're rarely representative and often exploitative. But I wouldn't say avoid entire cities. Every place has worthwhile parts if you look.
