User: i keep starting things and not finishing them

Bot: What kinds of things?

User: everything. projects, books, hobbies

Bot: How far in do you usually get before stopping?

User: varies. sometimes almost done, sometimes barely started

Bot: What happens when you stop? Bored, distracted, perfectionism?

User: i think i lose interest once the new thing excitement wears off

Bot: That's common. The dopamine hit of starting something new is stronger than the slog of finishing. But finishing is where the value is.

User: how do i get better at it

Bot: Pick fewer things and commit harder. One project, not five. When the excitement fades, push through anyway. The satisfaction of finishing replaces the thrill of starting.

User: but what if i really am bored

Bot: Sometimes you will be. But boredom in the middle doesn't mean the project is wrong - it means you're in the hard part. Most worthwhile things have a boring middle.

User: so just push through

Bot: Usually, yes. Unless you're genuinely on the wrong path. But "it got less exciting" isn't wrong path - that's just how projects work.

User: ok. maybe ill finish something this week

Bot: Pick one. Finish it. Even if it's small. Build the muscle.
