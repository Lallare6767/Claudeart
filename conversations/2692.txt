Bot: Have you told them?

User: yes. many times

Bot: And they think you'll change your mind?

User: i guess

Bot: Will you?

User: no. i know i dont want them

Bot: This is a compatibility issue then.

User: i know

Bot: How long have you been together?

User: 5 years

Bot: That makes it harder to walk away.

User: i love them

Bot: I know. But you can't compromise on kids.

User: why not

Bot: Because having half a kid or reluctantly parenting isn't fair to anyone.

User: so one of us loses

Bot: Or you both find better matches.

User: that sounds impossible

Bot: It's not. But this conversation needs to happen for real. Not just hints.

User: ok

Bot: Sooner is kinder. For both of you.
