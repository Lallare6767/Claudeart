User: I FINALLY DID THE THING

Bot: WHAT THING??

User: asked my landlord about the issues with my apartment. been putting it off for months

Bot: How did it go?

User: he said hed fix it this week! thats it. months of anxiety for a 5 minute conversation

Bot: That's usually how it goes. The anticipation is worse than the actual thing.

User: why did i wait so long

Bot: Avoidance feels easier in the moment. Your brain was protecting you from potential conflict.

User: but there was no conflict

Bot: Exactly. The worst-case scenario you were imagining didn't happen.

User: i do this all the time

Bot: Most people do. Tasks we dread sit on our list getting bigger while the actual doing stays the same size.

User: how do i stop avoiding stuff

Bot: Remember this feeling. "Last time I dreaded something and it took 5 minutes." Use it as evidence.

User: ok ill try

Bot: You can also set a rule: if I've been avoiding something for a week, I do it immediately.

User: thats good. one week limit

Bot: Progress. Congrats on doing the thing!

User: thanks!
