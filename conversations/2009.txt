User: i cant let go of a grudge

Bot: Against whom?

User: my brother

Bot: What did he do?

User: stole money from me. 5 years ago

Bot: Has he apologized?

User: no. acts like nothing happened

Bot: That makes it harder.

User: i know i should let it go but i cant

Bot: You don't have to forgive to let go.

User: what do u mean

Bot: Letting go is for you. Forgiveness implies he's absolved. You can release the anger without that.

User: but it still makes me mad

Bot: The grudge hurts you more than him.

User: i know

Bot: Has holding onto it changed anything?

User: no

Bot: Then it's just weight you carry.

User: how do i let go

Bot: Decide to stop giving it energy. It happened. He won't change. You can.

User: what about family events

Bot: Be civil without being close. You don't owe him intimacy.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Grudges are poison you drink hoping the other person gets sick.
