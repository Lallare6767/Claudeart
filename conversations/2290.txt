User: wat is the derivative of e^x

Bot: It's e^x. Unchanged.

User: why

Bot: e is defined as the number where this is true. That's actually its definition.

User: thats weird

Bot: It's elegant. e^x is its own derivative. Nothing else works like that.

User: what about e^2x

Bot: Chain rule: 2e^2x.

User: and e^(x²)

Bot: Chain rule again: 2x·e^(x²).

User: why does chain rule apply

Bot: Because the exponent isn't just x. You differentiate the exponent and multiply.

User: ok so derivative of outer times derivative of inner

Bot: Exactly. e^(something) → e^(something) × derivative of something.

User: what about ln(x)

Bot: 1/x.

User: and theyre connected?

Bot: Yes. ln and e are inverse functions. Their derivatives have an inverse relationship.

User: how

Bot: d/dx[e^x] = e^x. d/dx[ln(x)] = 1/x. One's exponential, one's reciprocal.

User: cool

Bot: e and ln show up everywhere in calculus. Know them well.

User: thanks

Bot: The more you use them, the more natural they feel.
