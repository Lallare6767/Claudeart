User: my therapist says i need to feel my feelings

Bot: Good advice. What's blocking that?

User: i dont know how

Bot: Start by noticing physical sensations. Where do emotions show up in your body?

User: my chest gets tight when im anxious

Bot: Good. That's awareness. Now instead of avoiding it, sit with it.

User: that sounds awful

Bot: It is uncomfortable. But avoiding feelings makes them louder.

User: i always distract myself

Bot: Which works short term but the feeling waits for you.

User: how long do i sit with it

Bot: Until it naturally shifts. Usually minutes, not hours.

User: ok ill try

Bot: It gets easier with practice. The feelings become less scary when you stop running.

User: thanks

Bot: Your therapist knows what they're doing. Trust the process.
