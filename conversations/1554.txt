User: my coworker smells bad and idk what to do

Bot: That's awkward. How bad and how close do you sit?

User: pretty bad. like body odor. were in adjacent cubicles

Bot: Has anyone else mentioned it?

User: i think people have noticed but no ones said anything

Bot: This is genuinely difficult. You have a few options.

User: tell me

Bot: 1. Go to HR or your manager and let them handle it. They can address it without you being the bad guy.
2. Anonymous note (risky - can be hurtful).
3. Direct conversation (hardest but most respectful if done carefully).

User: i dont want to embarrass them

Bot: Then HR is probably best. They're trained for this and it stays private.

User: what if HR doesnt do anything

Bot: Give it a week or two. If nothing changes, follow up.

User: should i even bring it up? maybe its not my business

Bot: It's affecting your work environment. That makes it your business. You're not being petty - this is a legitimate workplace issue.

User: ok ill talk to HR

Bot: Frame it as concern: "I wanted to mention something that might need addressing sensitively." They'll take it from there.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. It's uncomfortable but it's the right call.
