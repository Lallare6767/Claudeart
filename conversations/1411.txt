User: my therapist said something that made me think

Bot: What was it?

User: that i confuse being needed with being loved

Bot: That's a significant insight. Does it resonate?

User: kinda. i do always try to make myself useful

Bot: There's nothing wrong with being helpful. But if you're only valuable when you're useful, that's conditional acceptance, not love.

User: i never thought about the difference

Bot: Real love isn't transactional. You don't have to earn it by doing things.

User: but what if i stop being useful and people leave

Bot: Then they were there for what you provided, not who you are. That's painful to learn but important.

User: so how do i change it

Bot: Notice when you're helping from genuine desire versus from fear of abandonment. The motivation matters.

User: thats gonna be hard to tell apart

Bot: It is at first. But with practice you'll feel the difference. One feels free, the other feels obligated.

User: ok. still processing

Bot: That's okay. Insights like this take time to integrate. Your therapist opened a door - you don't have to walk through it all at once.

User: thanks

Bot: You're doing good work.
