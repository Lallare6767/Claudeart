User: write me a limerick about mondays

Bot: There once was a day we call Monday,
When work piled up in a bad way,
We'd yawn and we'd sigh,
Watch the clock, wonder why,
Then recover by drinking on Sunday.

User: haha thats great

Bot: Limericks are fun - the rhythm forces humor.

User: write one about coffee

Bot: A person who needed caffeine
Would guzzle it strong and not lean,
By cup number four,
They'd vibrate and roar,
The most energized wreck ever seen.

User: i feel attacked lol

Bot: We've all been that wreck.

User: one more. about being tired

Bot: My eyelids grew heavy as lead,
As I fought the desire for bed,
I said "just one more hour,"
But lost all my power,
And woke with a keyboard on head.

User: these are so good

Bot: AABBA rhythm with a twist at the end. That's the formula.

User: thanks for the laughs

Bot: Sleep well tonight. No keyboard faces.

User: ill try

Bot: Goodnight!
