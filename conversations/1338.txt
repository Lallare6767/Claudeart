User: help me come up with baby names

Bot: What's your style - classic, modern, unique? Any cultural considerations?

User: classic but not too common

Bot: Some options:

Girls: Eleanor, Clara, Violet, Margaret (Maggie), Josephine, Adelaide, Cecilia

Boys: Theodore, Julian, Bennett, Arthur, Sebastian, Felix, Graham

User: i like theodore

Bot: Theodore is great. Classic, nickname options (Theo, Ted, Teddy), literary associations, and just popular enough to be familiar without being overused.

User: what goes with theodore

Bot: For middle names or siblings?

User: middle

Bot: Theodore James, Theodore William, Theodore Charles, Theodore Grant. One or two syllables balances the three-syllable first name.

User: theodore james is nice

Bot: It flows well. James is timeless and looks good on applications decades from now.

User: what about for a girl

Bot: I like Eleanor from that list too. Eleanor Rose, Eleanor Grace, Eleanor Mae.

User: ooh eleanor rose

Bot: Beautiful. Both names are classic but not stodgy. Solid choices.

User: thanks. naming a human is stressful

Bot: They'll grow into it whatever you pick. You're clearly thinking about it carefully.
