User: help me write a complaint email to a company

Bot: What happened?

User: they sent me the wrong item twice and customer service keeps putting me on hold

Bot: Frustrating. What outcome do you want?

User: the right item or a refund. and maybe acknowledgment that they wasted my time

Bot: Okay. Professional but firm. Include order numbers and dates.

User: how do i start

Bot: State the issue clearly: "I'm writing regarding order #X placed on [date]. I have received the wrong item twice despite contacting customer service."

User: then what

Bot: Timeline of events. Each wrong shipment, each call, how long on hold.

User: ok

Bot: Then requested resolution: "I would like either the correct item shipped immediately or a full refund."

User: can i mention my frustration

Bot: Yes, but professionally. "This has been frustrating and time-consuming" is fine. No name-calling.

User: what about compensation

Bot: You can ask. "Given the repeated errors and time spent, I would appreciate a gesture of goodwill" like store credit.

User: should i threaten to go elsewhere

Bot: Only if you mean it. And frame it as consequence, not threat. "If unresolved, I'll need to take my business elsewhere."

User: ok this helps

Bot: Send it to the highest email you can find. Corporate usually responds faster.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. You deserve better service.
