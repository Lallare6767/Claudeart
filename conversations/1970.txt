User: i need to apologize to someone

Bot: What happened?

User: i said something really hurtful when i was angry

Bot: How long ago?

User: last week

Bot: Good that you're not waiting too long. What do you want to say?

User: that i was wrong and im sorry

Bot: Add what specifically you're sorry for, and what you'll do differently.

User: like what

Bot: "I'm sorry I said [specific thing]. It was cruel and untrue. I was angry but that's no excuse. I'll work on not lashing out when upset."

User: thats good

Bot: Don't make excuses or explain why. Just own it.

User: should i do it in person

Bot: If possible, yes. Text apologies feel lighter.

User: ok ill ask to meet

Bot: Give them space to respond however they need.

User: what if they dont forgive me

Bot: That's their right. Apologize because it's right, not for a guaranteed outcome.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck. It takes courage to apologize well.
