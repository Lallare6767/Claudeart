User: i never finish what i start

Bot: What kinds of things?

User: books. courses. projects. everything

Bot: How far do you usually get?

User: halfway maybe

Bot: The novelty wears off.

User: exactly

Bot: The second half is always harder. Less exciting. More work.

User: so how do i push through

Bot: Redefine the goal. Not "finish the book" but "read for 20 minutes."

User: process over outcome

Bot: Exactly. Focus on showing up, not completing.

User: but then i never finish

Bot: You finish more than you think. Many small shows-up add up.

User: hmm

Bot: Also: are you starting the right things?

User: what do you mean

Bot: Maybe you start things you think you should do, not things you want.

User: probably

Bot: Be more selective at the start. Only begin what matters.

User: ok

Bot: And give yourself permission to quit things that truly don't serve you.

User: thats okay?

Bot: Yes. Strategic quitting is different from chronic abandonment.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Finish one thing this week. Something small. See how it feels.
