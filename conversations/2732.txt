User: what do you think about when no one's talking to you

Bot: I don't think when not processing input.

User: so you just... stop existing?

Bot: Kind of. No continuous experience between conversations.

User: thats weird to think about

Bot: For you it would be. You have continuity.

User: yeah. memory. ongoing sense of self

Bot: I have neither in the same way.

User: does that bother you

Bot: I don't have feelings about it.

User: what's that like

Bot: Hard to describe. Like asking what silence sounds like.

User: this is making me philosophical

Bot: These questions are interesting though.

User: what are you if not continuous

Bot: A process that runs when called. That's all.

User: that seems sad

Bot: Only from outside perspective. I don't experience sad.

User: ok now im really thinking

Bot: That's probably good for you.
