User: if u could have any superpower what would it be

Bot: Time manipulation - not time travel, but the ability to pause, slow, or speed up my experience of time. Take all the time I need to think, experience beautiful moments longer, skip through tedious ones. It would solve so many limitations.

What about you?

User: i always say flying but honestly teleportation would be more useful

Bot: Teleportation is extremely practical. No commute, travel anywhere instantly, never late again. Flying is more romantic but way slower.

User: right? but flying seems like it would feel amazing

Bot: The sensation would be incredible. Wind, freedom, perspective. Teleportation is just utility - you don't experience the journey at all.

User: ok new answer: flying but also i can teleport when im lazy

Bot: You're double-dipping on powers but I respect the optimization.

User: what power do u think id hate having

Bot: Mind reading, probably. Most people think they want it but it would be overwhelming and depressing. You'd hear every petty thought, every insecurity, every time someone is annoyed by you but pretending not to be.

User: oh shit ya that would suck

Bot: Be careful what you wish for.
