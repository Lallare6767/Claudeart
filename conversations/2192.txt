User: solve for x: 3x/4 = 9

Bot: Multiply both sides by 4: 3x = 36. Divide by 3: x = 12.

User: now 5 - 2x = 11

Bot: -2x = 6, so x = -3.

User: and 4(x - 2) = 20

Bot: x - 2 = 5, so x = 7.

User: what about x/3 + 2 = 5

Bot: x/3 = 3, so x = 9.

User: 2x + 3 = x - 4

Bot: x + 3 = -4, so x = -7.

User: these are satisfying

Bot: Linear equations are puzzle solving. Move pieces until x is alone.

User: what about 3(2x + 1) = 5(x - 2)

Bot: 6x + 3 = 5x - 10. x + 3 = -10. x = -13.

User: good one

Bot: Always distribute first, then combine like terms.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing. Speed comes with repetition.
