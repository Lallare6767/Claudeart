User: i keep secrets from everyone

Bot: Everyone, or just certain people?

User: everyone. different secrets from different people

Bot: Why?

User: scared they wont accept the real me

Bot: So you show different versions to different people.

User: yeah

Bot: That's exhausting. And lonely.

User: it is

Bot: What would happen if you showed someone all of you?

User: they might leave

Bot: They might. But then you'd know the relationship was conditional.

User: isnt that worse

Bot: No. Unconditional relationships exist. But you can't find them while hiding.

User: how do i start

Bot: Pick one person you trust. Share one thing you've hidden.

User: thats terrifying

Bot: Yes. But necessary for real connection.

User: what if it goes badly

Bot: Then that person wasn't safe. Better to know now.

User: ok

Bot: Authenticity is risk. But the alternative is never being truly known.

User: i want to be known

Bot: Then let yourself be seen. Start small.
