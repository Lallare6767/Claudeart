User: i want a pet but idk which one

Bot: What's your living situation? Apartment, house, yard?

User: apartment. medium sized

Bot: Any restrictions from your lease on pets?

User: cats and small dogs are fine. no exotic animals

Bot: How much time do you have for care? Dogs need walks and more attention than cats.

User: i work from home so time isnt an issue

Bot: Do you want something interactive or more independent?

User: interactive. i want companionship

Bot: Dog sounds right then. Cats can be companionable but dogs are consistently more actively engaged.

User: what breed

Bot: For an apartment: consider size and energy level. A cavalier king charles, french bulldog, or even a small mixed breed from a shelter.

User: i was thinking about adopting

Bot: Great option. Shelter dogs are often already trained and you can see their personality before committing.

User: any downsides to adopting

Bot: Sometimes health or behavioral history is unknown. But shelters usually do temperament testing and can match you well.

User: ok ill visit a shelter this weekend

Bot: Take your time meeting dogs. The right one will feel obvious.
