User: is it normal to not want kids

Bot: Completely normal. Plenty of people don't want them and that's a valid choice.

User: i feel like everyone assumes i will

Bot: Society has a strong narrative that adulthood includes kids. But it's not required and it's not for everyone.

User: my family pressures me about it

Bot: That's frustrating but common. They might come around eventually, or they might not. Either way, having a child to satisfy family expectations is a bad reason.

User: what do i say when they ask

Bot: "I don't want kids" is a complete answer. You can elaborate if you want but you don't owe anyone a justification.

User: they always say ill change my mind

Bot: Some people do. Most people who say they don't want kids don't. You know yourself better than they do.

User: what if i regret it later

Bot: Possible. But regretting not having kids is much less harmful than regretting having them. At least in the first scenario, only you experience the regret.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: The stakes are asymmetric. A child exists who didn't consent to existing. That matters more than "what if I change my mind."

User: ok thanks for the validation

Bot: Your life, your choice. You don't owe anyone a baby.
