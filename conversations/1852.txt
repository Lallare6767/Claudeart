User: what do i do if my friend is in a toxic relationship

Bot: Are they aware it's toxic?

User: i dont think so. or theyre in denial

Bot: What specifically makes it toxic?

User: controlling behavior. isolation. they changed since being together

Bot: Those are serious signs.

User: i want to say something

Bot: Be careful how you approach it. Attacking the partner usually backfires.

User: what should i do instead

Bot: Express concern about the friend, not judgment of the partner. "I've noticed you seem less happy" not "your partner is awful."

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: They probably will. Your job is to stay available, not to convince them.

User: so just wait

Bot: Stay present. Keep inviting them to things. Don't let them be completely isolated.

User: this is hard

Bot: It is. You can't force someone to see what they're not ready to see.

User: what if it gets worse

Bot: Document your concerns. Be ready if they need to leave. Know local resources.

User: should i call someone

Bot: Not yet unless there's immediate danger. But educate yourself on the signs.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You're being a good friend by caring. Just be patient and available.
