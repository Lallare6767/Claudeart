User: im scared of dying

Bot: That's one of the most universal fears there is. What's bringing it up?

User: just been thinking about it more lately

Bot: Any particular trigger or just general existential thoughts?

User: general. like the idea of not existing freaks me out

Bot: The concept of non-existence is fundamentally unimaginable because you need to exist to imagine anything. Your brain literally can't process it.

User: thats somehow worse

Bot: Or maybe it's better - if you can't experience non-existence, there's nothing to fear about the state itself.

User: but the missing out

Bot: On things you won't know you're missing. This is where it gets philosophical - does something you'll never be aware of missing actually matter?

User: my brain hurts

Bot: These questions don't have answers that make the fear go away. What sometimes helps is focusing on making the time you have meaningful.

User: easier said than done

Bot: True. But it beats spiraling about something inevitable and unknowable.

User: i guess. thanks for not being weird about it

Bot: Death is a normal thing to think about. Your feelings about it are valid.
