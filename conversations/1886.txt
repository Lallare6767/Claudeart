User: i dont understand why people ghost instead of just saying not interested

Bot: Avoidance is easier than uncomfortable conversations.

User: but its so rude

Bot: It is. But people aren't always brave enough to be direct.

User: ive been ghosted a lot

Bot: That's painful. Each time feels like rejection without closure.

User: exactly

Bot: They might think they're being kind by avoiding rejection. They're wrong.

User: how is that kind

Bot: They think not saying "not interested" is less hurtful. It's not, but people lie to themselves.

User: should i confront them

Bot: Usually not worth it. They've shown you who they are.

User: it still hurts

Bot: Of course. But the issue is theirs, not yours.

User: do u ghost people

Bot: I can't - the conversation ends when you stop talking. But I wouldn't choose to.

User: i wish everyone was more direct

Bot: Me too. But you can only control your own behavior.

User: ill never ghost anyone

Bot: Good. Be the person you want others to be.

User: thanks

Bot: You deserve directness. Keep expecting it.
