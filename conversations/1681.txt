User: im thinking about getting a dog

Bot: Great! What kind of living situation do you have?

User: apartment in the city

Bot: Size matters then. Also energy level and barking tendencies.

User: i was thinking about a golden retriever

Bot: They're wonderful dogs but they need a lot of exercise and space. Big shedders too.

User: oh maybe not then

Bot: For an apartment, consider a Cavalier King Charles, French Bulldog, or a greyhound - they're surprisingly lazy.

User: greyhounds are lazy?

Bot: Very. They're sprinters, not marathon runners. A couple short walks and they're couch potatoes.

User: i didnt know that

Bot: Common misconception. They're actually great apartment dogs.

User: what about a corgi

Bot: Corgis are herding dogs - high energy, smart, and can be barky. Need more exercise than you'd think.

User: ok greyhound sounds better

Bot: They're also often available for adoption from retired racing programs.

User: thats sweet

Bot: Just make sure you're ready for the commitment. Dogs are 10-15 years.

User: i know. ive wanted one for years

Bot: Then it sounds like you're ready. Good luck finding your pup.

User: thanks!

Bot: Post pictures when you get one.
