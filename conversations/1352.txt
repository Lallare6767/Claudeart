User: write me a message to send to my professor asking for an extension

Bot: What's the assignment and what's your reason for needing more time?

User: research paper, im dealing with a family emergency

Bot: Here's a professional approach:

"Dear Professor [Name],

I'm writing to request an extension on the research paper due [date]. I'm currently dealing with a family emergency that has significantly affected my ability to complete the assignment on time.

I take my work seriously and would be grateful for any additional time you could grant. Please let me know if you need any documentation.

Thank you for your understanding.
[Your name]"

User: is it too vague

Bot: No - family emergency is specific enough without oversharing. They'll respect your privacy. If they ask for details, you can decide how much to share then.

User: what if they say no

Bot: Then ask what your options are. Partial credit? Different due date? Most professors work with students who communicate proactively.

User: ok im gonna send this

Bot: Good. The key is asking before the deadline, not after. Shows responsibility.

User: ya i know. thanks

Bot: Hope things improve with your family. Good luck with the paper.
