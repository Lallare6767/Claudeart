User: write me a sick leave email

Bot: How formal is your workplace and what's wrong with you (or what are you claiming)?

User: pretty casual and i have a bad cold

Bot: "Hey [Manager], I woke up with a nasty cold and won't be in today. I'll monitor email if anything urgent comes up but mostly need to rest. Should be back tomorrow. Thanks."

User: perfect thats exactly what i needed

Bot: Feel better. Drink fluids and actually rest instead of working from bed.

User: lol ya ill try

Bot: I'm serious. Half-assing rest just makes you sick longer. Commit to the sick day.

User: ok ok i will. thanks

Bot: Good. Get well.
