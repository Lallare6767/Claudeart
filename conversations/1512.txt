User: give me a writing prompt but make it specific

Bot: A museum security guard realizes one painting's subject has been in a slightly different position every morning for a week.

User: oh thats creepy. another one?

Bot: Your character finds their own handwriting in a used book from a store they've never visited in a city they've never been to.

User: also creepy! something not horror

Bot: A couple on a first date discovers they were both assigned to write reviews of the same obscure restaurant - but for competing publications.

User: oh fun. one more?

Bot: An elderly woman teaches her neighbor's kid to bake, and he accidentally discovers a secret ingredient that's been in her award-winning pie for 60 years.

User: whats the secret ingredient

Bot: That's for you to decide. Maybe it's embarrassingly simple. Maybe it's something unexpected. Maybe she's been lying about it.

User: i like the lying angle

Bot: Creates good conflict. Trust, deception, why she kept it secret, what the kid does with the information.

User: ok im gonna write this one

Bot: Enjoy! Let the characters surprise you.

User: will do. thanks!

Bot: Happy writing.
