User: im so done with social media

Bot: What pushed you over the edge?

User: its just constant comparison and negativity. i always feel worse after scrolling

Bot: That's enough reason to quit. Have you tried before?

User: ya but i always come back

Bot: What pulls you back?

User: fear of missing out mostly. and boredom

Bot: FOMO fades after a week or two - you realize you're not missing much. The boredom is trickier. You need replacement activities or you'll default back.

User: like what

Bot: Whatever you used to do before phones. Read, walk, call people instead of liking their posts. The goal is active engagement instead of passive consumption.

User: that sounds harder

Bot: It is at first. Then it becomes normal and scrolling starts to feel like the weird choice.

User: should i delete the apps or just limit my time

Bot: Delete. Limiting never works because the apps are designed to defeat your willpower. Take away the option entirely, at least for a month.

User: a month is a long time

Bot: It's also how long it takes to break a habit. You can do a month.

User: ok fine. im deleting instagram rn

Bot: Good luck. The first week is the hardest. After that it gets much easier.
