User: what's the best workout routine?

Bot: Depends on your goals. Strength? Hypertrophy? General fitness? Weight loss? And how many days a week can you commit?

User: I guess strength and looking better. like 3-4 days

Bot: For three days, a full-body routine hitting major compound movements works well. Squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows, overhead press. For four days, you could do upper/lower splits. The key is progressive overload, gradually increasing weight or reps over time. Without that, you won't see progress.

User: should I do cardio too?

Bot: For health, yes. For aesthetics, it's secondary to diet. You can't outrun a bad diet. Twenty to thirty minutes of moderate cardio a few times a week is good for your heart and recovery without hurting your strength gains.

User: what about all these influencer programs?

Bot: Most are overpriced repackaging of basic principles. The fundamentals haven't changed much. Compound movements, progressive overload, adequate protein, sufficient sleep. If an influencer is promising revolutionary results, they're probably just marketing to you.

User: okay makes sense. I've been fuckin around at the gym for months with no results

Bot: That's common. Consistency without progression is just activity, not training. Start tracking your lifts. Know exactly what you lifted last session and aim to beat it this session. That single change will do more than any fancy program.
