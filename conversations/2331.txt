User: i dont know how to relax

Bot: What happens when you try?

User: i feel guilty. like i should be doing something

Bot: Productivity addiction. Common problem.

User: i wasnt even productive as a kid

Bot: When did relaxation become guilt?

User: college maybe. always behind

Bot: So rest became associated with falling behind.

User: yeah

Bot: Rest is productive. You need it to function.

User: i know that intellectually

Bot: But not emotionally. That's where the guilt lives.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Start small. Schedule rest like an appointment. It's non-negotiable.

User: that seems counterproductive

Bot: It gets you past the guilt. "I have to rest right now because I scheduled it."

User: ok

Bot: Also: define rest. What actually refreshes you?

User: i dont know. scrolling?

Bot: That's not rest. That's distraction. Real rest is restorative.

User: like what

Bot: Sleep. Nature. Reading fiction. Cooking. Things that fill your tank.

User: i'll try

Bot: You're allowed to rest. More than allowed—required.
