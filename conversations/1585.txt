User: i dont know what i want to do with my life

Bot: How old are you?

User: 24

Bot: That's normal. Most 24-year-olds don't know.

User: but i should have figured it out by now

Bot: Says who? That's a cultural myth. Lots of people don't find their thing until 30s or later.

User: what do i do in the meantime

Bot: Try things. You can't figure out what you like by thinking - you have to actually do.

User: like what

Bot: Jobs, hobbies, projects, volunteering. Anything that gives you data about what you enjoy and what you're good at.

User: what if i dont like anything

Bot: Then you haven't tried enough things. "Nothing" usually means "nothing in a narrow range."

User: i guess ive mostly done safe stuff

Bot: There you go. Safe doesn't give you information. You need to experiment.

User: what if i fail

Bot: You will. That's the point. Failure is data.

User: ok. ill try something new

Bot: Make it specific. What's one thing you'll try this month?

User: maybe a pottery class

Bot: Perfect. Low stakes, might be fun, gives you new information.
