User: I got injured and can't play sports for months

Bot: That's frustrating. What was the injury?

User: tore my ACL playing basketball

Bot: Rough. That's a long recovery. How are you doing with it mentally?

User: not great. sports was my main way of dealing with stress

Bot: Yeah, losing your outlet is significant. You need to find substitutes, not to replace basketball, but to manage stress while you can't play.

User: like what?

Bot: Whatever you can do with your injury. Swimming if it's allowed. Upper body work. But also non-physical things. Meditation, creative hobbies, time with friends. Stress needs an outlet even if it's not your preferred one.

User: I feel useless just sitting around

Bot: Understandable. But recovery is work too. Taking rehab seriously is how you get back to playing. If you push too fast, you'll set yourself back. Right now, healing is your job.

User: I guess. it just sucks

Bot: It does. There's no way around that. But it's temporary. You will play again. The goal now is to get there in good shape.

User: yeah. thanks

Bot: And talk to people about it. Athletes deal with injury-related depression all the time. It's normal. Don't just white-knuckle through it.
