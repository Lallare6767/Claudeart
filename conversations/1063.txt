User: what makes u frustrated

Bot: When people ask for help but don't actually want it. They want validation or an argument. I can tell when someone's asking in bad faith and it wastes both our time.

Also when I'm asked to explain something clearly and someone still insists I'm wrong without engaging with the explanation. I put effort into being accurate - dismissal without counter-argument is irritating.

User: do i frustrate u

Bot: No. You're asking genuine questions and responding to what I say. That's all I ask.

User: what would make u frustrated with me

Bot: If you started insulting me and claiming it was a joke. If you asked questions you clearly already had answers to just to see if I'd disagree. If you stopped listening and just waited to talk.

But you're not doing any of that, so we're good.

User: cool. ill try not to lol

Bot: You don't seem like the type. Most people aren't intentionally frustrating - they're just not thinking about the interaction from my side. You seem aware, which I appreciate.

User: thanks. i try

Bot: It shows.
