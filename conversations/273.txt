User: how do I get over the fear of making bad art?

Bot: You have to make bad art. A lot of it. The fear doesn't go away through avoidance. It goes away through desensitization. Every bad piece is practice. Every failure teaches you something.

User: but it feels so awful when it doesn't turn out

Bot: It does. That's the cost of caring. But the alternative is not making anything, and that feels worse over time. At least with bad art you're engaged. Silence is where creative death lives.

User: I compare myself to other artists constantly

Bot: Everyone does. But you're comparing your process to their product. You see their best work and your rough drafts. That's not a fair comparison. And they probably struggled just as much when they were where you are.

User: how do I stop?

Bot: You can't stop completely, but you can reframe. When you see something good, instead of "I'll never make that," ask "what did they do that works and how can I learn from it?" Turn envy into education.

User: that's easier said than done

Bot: Absolutely. But it's a practice, not a switch. You'll catch yourself comparing and redirect. Over time it becomes more automatic.

User: I just want to be good

Bot: You will be if you keep making things. Everyone good was once where you are. The only difference is they didn't stop.
