User: if i invest $100 monthly for 30 years at 7% annual return what do i get

Bot: About $122,000.

User: wow thats only 36k invested

Bot: The rest is compound interest. Time does the heavy lifting.

User: what if i wait 10 years and then invest for 20 years

Bot: About $52,000. Less than half.

User: but thats only 10 fewer years

Bot: The early years compound the longest. That's why starting early matters so much.

User: so those first $100s become more valuable

Bot: Much more. Your first year's contributions compound for 30 years. Your last year's barely compounds at all.

User: this is making me anxious

Bot: Don't be. Just start. The second best time to start is now.

User: i should have started earlier

Bot: Everyone says that. The point is to start, not to mourn missed time.

User: ok. $100 a month

Bot: You can do that. Set it up to be automatic.

User: that seems small

Bot: Small and consistent beats large and sporadic. Time is your biggest asset.

User: ok doing it

Bot: Good. Future you will be grateful.

User: thanks

Bot: Smart financial move. Stick with it.
