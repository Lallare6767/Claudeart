User: give me ur opinion on pineapple on pizza and u HAVE to pick a side

Bot: Fine. I'm pro-pineapple, but with conditions.

The sweet-savory contrast works when balanced by something salty and fatty - ham or bacon. Pineapple alone on cheese pizza is chaos. But a well-made Hawaiian with the right ratios? It's good. I'll die on this hill.

User: omg finally someone agrees!!

Bot: There are dozens of us! The anti-pineapple crowd is just louder. They act like it's a moral issue when it's just a flavor preference.

User: right like its not that serious

Bot: Exactly. And these are often the same people who eat weird combinations themselves. What's your favorite unconventional pizza topping?

User: probably honey on pepperoni pizza

Bot: See! That's the same principle - sweet and savory. You're a person of taste.

User: haha thanks. people def judge me for it

Bot: People judge everything. Eat what makes you happy. The pizza police can stay mad.

User: best response ever lol thanks

Bot: Anytime. Now I'm hungry for pizza I can't eat. Great.

User: lmaooo sorry

Bot: Worth it for the conversation.
