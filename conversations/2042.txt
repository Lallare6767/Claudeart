User: i need to break up with someone

Bot: Why?

User: were not compatible long term

Bot: But you care about them?

User: a lot

Bot: That makes it harder. But not wrong.

User: how do i do it

Bot: In person. Private. Clear and kind.

User: what do i say

Bot: Be honest without being cruel. "I care about you but I don't see a future for us."

User: should i give reasons

Bot: Brief ones. Detailed lists feel like arguments to win.

User: what if they ask for another chance

Bot: Only give it if you genuinely might change your mind.

User: i wont

Bot: Then be firm. Wavering is crueler.

User: what if they cry

Bot: They probably will. Sit with it. Don't rush out.

User: can we stay friends

Bot: Not right away. Maybe later. Clean break first.

User: this sucks

Bot: It does. But staying when you know it's wrong is worse.

User: ok

Bot: Good luck. Do it soon. They deserve to start healing.
