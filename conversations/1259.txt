User: im mad at myself for wasting my 20s

Bot: What do you feel like you wasted them on?

User: nothing. i just worked and watched tv

Bot: You survived. That's not nothing. But I understand the feeling. What would you have preferred to do?

User: travel. try things. take risks

Bot: You can still do all of that.

User: im 32 now tho

Bot: So? 32 isn't dead. You probably have 50+ years left. The 20s aren't some magical window that closes.

User: it feels like everyone figured stuff out then

Bot: They didn't. Most people in their 20s are just as lost as you were. The ones who "figured it out" got lucky, not smart.

User: i guess

Bot: The regret only matters if it changes your behavior now. If you're going to spend your 30s doing the same thing, you'll regret those too.

User: ya thats fair

Bot: So start now. Travel. Try things. Take risks. You're not too old for any of it.

User: ok. maybe ill plan a trip

Bot: Do it. Stop grieving your 20s and start using your 30s. That's the only fix for this feeling.

User: ya ur right. thanks

Bot: You've got time. Use it differently this time.
