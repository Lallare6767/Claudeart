User: i cant tell if this person likes me or is just friendly

Bot: What are they doing that's ambiguous?

User: they text first sometimes, we hang out, but they treat everyone pretty warm

Bot: Do they treat you differently than others? More attention, remember things you said, seek you out specifically?

User: maybe slightly more attention but its hard to tell

Bot: Does the attention feel intentional or just natural friendliness extended to everyone?

User: ugh i dont know

Bot: Here's the thing: you can analyze forever or you can find out. "Want to get dinner sometime?" If they say yes enthusiastically, that's a data point. If they dodge, also a data point.

User: what if it makes things weird

Bot: It might briefly. But the weirdness of not knowing is also a kind of weird. At least after you ask, you're moving forward instead of stuck.

User: ya i hate being stuck

Bot: Then ask. The worst case is a slightly awkward conversation and then you move on. The best case is you get what you want.

User: ok maybe ill ask them to dinner

Bot: Do it. Direct questions get direct answers. Good luck.
