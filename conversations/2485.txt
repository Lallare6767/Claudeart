User: i just want to feel normal

Bot: What does normal feel like?

User: not anxious all the time. not overthinking. just okay

Bot: When was the last time you felt that?

User: cant remember

Bot: So "normal" is something you're imagining, not remembering.

User: i guess

Bot: That matters. You might be chasing something that doesn't exist.

User: so i should accept feeling bad

Bot: No. But maybe adjust the goal.

User: to what

Bot: Manageable. Better. Not perfect "normal."

User: that seems like lowering expectations

Bot: It's realistic expectations. Which are actually achievable.

User: ok

Bot: Also: many people feel anxious and think it's just them. It's common.

User: so this is normal?

Bot: It might be. Ironic.

User: huh

Bot: You might be normal and not know it because you imagine others are different.

User: thats wild

Bot: Ask people. You'll be surprised how many feel like you.

User: ok

Bot: Work on feeling better, not normal. Better is enough.
