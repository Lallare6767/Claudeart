User: my roommate never cleans the common spaces

Bot: Have you talked to them about it?

User: ya but nothing changes

Bot: What did you say and how did they respond?

User: i said it bothered me and they said theyd do better

Bot: But they didn't?

User: cleaned once then went back to normal

Bot: You might need a more concrete system - schedule, checklist, clear expectations.

User: i shouldnt have to manage them

Bot: You shouldn't. But the alternative is living in mess or doing it all yourself.

User: what about a chore chart

Bot: Can work if you both commit to it. Written agreements are easier to enforce than verbal.

User: what if they still dont do it

Bot: Then you have a bigger conversation. "This living situation isn't working for me."

User: like move out?

Bot: Or find a new roommate. If someone consistently doesn't meet basic shared responsibilities, it won't get better.

User: ugh housing is so expensive

Bot: It is. That's why people tolerate bad roommates. But your mental health costs too.

User: ill try the chore chart first

Bot: Good start. Give it a month with real consequences if it's not followed.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck.
