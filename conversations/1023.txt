User: help me write a sick leave email to my boss

Bot: Sure. A few questions:
- How formal is your workplace?
- What's the nature of the illness - do you need to specify or just say you're unwell?
- How long do you expect to be out?

User: pretty formal. i dont want to overshare just say im sick. probably just today

Bot: Here you go:

Subject: Sick Leave Request - [Today's Date]

Dear [Boss's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unwell and will not be able to come into work today. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

I will monitor my email periodically throughout the day for any urgent matters. If my condition does not improve, I will update you regarding tomorrow's availability.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

User: can u make it shorter

Bot: Subject: Sick Leave - [Date]

Hi [Boss],

I'm not feeling well and need to take a sick day today. I'll check email for anything urgent and keep you updated on tomorrow.

Thank you,

User: perfect

Bot: Feel better! And actually rest - don't spend your sick day doing work stuff.

User: lol ok mom

Bot: I mean it! Being sick and working anyway just makes you sick longer. Take care of yourself.
