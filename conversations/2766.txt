User: i keep waiting for the other shoe to drop

Bot: When something good happens?

User: yeah. like its going to be taken away

Bot: That's anxiety about good things.

User: i cant just enjoy anything

Bot: Always waiting for disaster.

User: exactly

Bot: Has this happened before? Something good followed by something bad?

User: yes. a lot when i was younger

Bot: So your brain learned that pattern.

User: and now it expects it

Bot: Yes. Its trying to protect you.

User: but it ruins good things

Bot: It does. You're bracing for impact instead of enjoying.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Recognize it as a pattern, not truth. Challenge the thought.

User: like how

Bot: "I expect something bad because of the past. That doesnt mean it will happen."

User: thats hard to believe

Bot: It takes practice. But the pattern isnt reality. Its learned fear.
