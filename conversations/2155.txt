User: i have imposter syndrome bad today

Bot: What triggered it?

User: meeting with senior people. felt like i shouldnt be there

Bot: Were you invited?

User: yeah

Bot: Then someone thought you belonged.

User: they made a mistake

Bot: Multiple people independently made the same mistake?

User: i guess not

Bot: The impostor feeling lies to you.

User: how do i make it stop

Bot: You probably can't completely. But you can manage it.

User: how

Bot: Name it when it happens. "That's impostor syndrome talking."

User: and then

Bot: Ask: what evidence contradicts this feeling?

User: i was invited. i have the job

Bot: Right. Evidence matters more than feelings here.

User: it still feels true

Bot: Feelings aren't facts. They're just feelings.

User: ok

Bot: Also: most people in that room have felt the same way.

User: you think?

Bot: Especially successful people. Imposter syndrome hits them hardest.

User: ok thats somewhat comforting

Bot: You belong. Even if you don't feel it yet.
