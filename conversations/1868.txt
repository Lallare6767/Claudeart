User: i keep comparing my insides to others outsides

Bot: That's a common trap. What specifically are you comparing?

User: how confident everyone seems when im a mess inside

Bot: They're also a mess inside. They're just better at hiding it.

User: but they seem so together

Bot: Because you don't have access to their insides.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Remember that their curated version isn't their real version. You're comparing unfairly.

User: but i still feel bad

Bot: Notice when you're doing it. "I'm comparing my insides to their outsides again."

User: then what

Bot: Remind yourself of the bias. You know your worst thoughts. You only see their best presentation.

User: this sounds like cognitive behavioral therapy

Bot: It is, basically. Catch the thought, examine it, reframe it.

User: does that actually work

Bot: With practice. Thought patterns are habitual. You can change habits.

User: ill try to notice it more

Bot: Good start. The noticing is most of the work.

User: thanks

Bot: Everyone feels like a mess. Some just perform better.

User: that makes me feel better actually

Bot: Good. You're not uniquely broken.
