Bot: That sounds perfect. How long have you been together?

User: 4 years!

Bot: Four years of knowing they're the one. That's beautiful. When are you thinking for the wedding?

User: were thinking next fall

Bot: Nice. Long enough to plan, short enough to stay excited. Have you started thinking about what kind of wedding?

User: small, like 50 people max. we dont want a big thing

Bot: Smart. Small weddings are often more meaningful. Less production, more actual moments.

User: exactly! we want it to feel like us

Bot: That's the way to do it. Don't let family pressure you into a bigger thing than you want.

User: oh theyre already trying lol

Bot: Hold the line. It's your day.

User: ya we will. im just so happy rn

Bot: You should be! This is one of the big good things. Soak it in. Congratulations to you both!
