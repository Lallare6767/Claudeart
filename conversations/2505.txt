User: im grieving and dont know what to do

Bot: Who did you lose?

User: my grandmother. she raised me

Bot: I'm sorry. That's a profound loss.

User: it doesnt feel real

Bot: That's normal. Shock comes first.

User: when does it get better

Bot: Grief doesn't follow a timeline. And "better" might not be the word.

User: what then

Bot: Integrated. The loss becomes part of you. It doesn't go away.

User: that sounds terrible

Bot: It's hard. But you can carry grief and still live fully.

User: i dont know how to do anything right now

Bot: Then don't. Be with the grief. Let people help you.

User: im supposed to plan the funeral

Bot: Can someone else handle it? Or help?

User: maybe my aunt

Bot: Ask her. You don't have to do everything.

User: ok

Bot: And take time off work. Bereavement isn't something you power through.

User: ok

Bot: I'm sorry for your loss. She mattered. Your grief shows that.

User: thank you

Bot: Take care of yourself. One hour at a time.
