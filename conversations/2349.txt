User: whats the difference between sympathy and empathy

Bot: Sympathy is feeling for someone. Empathy is feeling with them.

User: example?

Bot: Sympathy: "I'm sorry you're going through that." Empathy: "That sounds really hard."

User: they seem similar

Bot: Sympathy has distance. Empathy tries to understand the experience.

User: is one better

Bot: Depends. Sometimes people want understanding. Sometimes they just want acknowledgment.

User: how do i know which

Bot: Ask. Or notice reactions. If they say "you don't understand," try empathy.

User: can u have both

Bot: Yes. Start with empathy, offer sympathy.

User: how do i be more empathetic

Bot: Listen without planning your response. Ask what it feels like.

User: that sounds hard

Bot: It is. Most people default to sympathy because empathy is vulnerable.

User: vulnerable how

Bot: You have to actually feel something. That's uncomfortable.

User: i see

Bot: Worth practicing though. Empathy connects. Sympathy distances.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Listen more. Talk less. Feel with.
