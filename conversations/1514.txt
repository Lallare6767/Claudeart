User: simplify this fraction: 18/24

Bot: 3/4.

User: show steps

Bot: Find the GCD (greatest common divisor) of 18 and 24. It's 6. Divide both by 6: 18÷6 = 3, 24÷6 = 4. So 18/24 = 3/4.

User: how did u find the gcd

Bot: List factors: 18 = 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. 24 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Largest common one is 6.

User: ok do 36/48

Bot: GCD is 12. 36÷12 = 3, 48÷12 = 4. So also 3/4.

User: oh cool same answer

Bot: 18/24 and 36/48 are equivalent fractions - both reduce to 3/4.

User: what about 45/60

Bot: GCD is 15. 45÷15 = 3, 60÷15 = 4. Also 3/4.

User: wow

Bot: All multiples of 3/4 reduce back to it. That's what equivalent fractions mean.

User: this is helping it make more sense

Bot: Once you see fractions as ratios rather than just numbers, it clicks.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing. It becomes automatic.
