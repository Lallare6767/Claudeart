User: ugh i hate group projects

Bot: What's going wrong?

User: one person does nothing and well still all get the same grade

Bot: Classic free rider problem. Have you talked to them directly?

User: ya they always have excuses

Bot: Document everything. If they don't contribute, you'll have evidence for the professor.

User: we tried dividing work evenly but they just dont do their part

Bot: Can you restructure so their part isn't critical? Give them something isolated that won't tank the project if they fail?

User: maybe the easiest section

Bot: That's strategic. You can't force them to care, but you can minimize the damage.

User: should i tell the professor

Bot: After the project, with documentation. During the project it often backfires and creates more drama.

User: this is so frustrating

Bot: It is. Group projects are meant to teach collaboration but often just teach how to work around people who don't pull their weight.

User: lol true

Bot: Get through this one, document, and request different group members next time if possible.
