User: convert 68 fahrenheit to celsius

Bot: 20°C.

User: how do u do that

Bot: Subtract 32, then multiply by 5/9. So (68-32) × 5/9 = 36 × 5/9 = 20.

User: what about 86 fahrenheit

Bot: 30°C. (86-32) × 5/9 = 54 × 5/9 = 30.

User: and celsius to fahrenheit

Bot: Opposite. Multiply by 9/5, then add 32.

User: so 25 celsius

Bot: 77°F. 25 × 9/5 + 32 = 45 + 32 = 77.

User: i can never remember the formula

Bot: Remember this: 16°C = 61°F. The digits flip. That's your anchor point.

User: oh thats clever

Bot: Then you can estimate from there. Every 5°C is about 9°F.

User: thanks that helps

Bot: Temperature conversions are annoying. Most people just use Google.

User: lol fair

Bot: But now you know how it works.
