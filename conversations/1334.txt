User: how do i stop being a people pleaser

Bot: First recognize what it's costing you. You're probably exhausted, resentful, and losing yourself trying to make everyone happy.

User: ya thats accurate

Bot: People pleasing usually comes from needing approval or fearing rejection. Does that sound right?

User: yes exactly

Bot: The fix is practicing discomfort. Say no to something small and let yourself feel the anxiety without caving. The anxiety decreases with practice.

User: but what if they get upset

Bot: They might. But their upset is their responsibility, not yours. You're not required to manage everyone's emotions.

User: that feels selfish

Bot: It's not selfish - it's having boundaries. Selfish is taking without regard for others. Boundaries is not giving beyond what's healthy for you.

User: i feel like i need to be needed

Bot: That's the trap. If your value comes from being useful to others, you'll never feel secure. Your worth exists regardless of what you do for people.

User: thats hard to believe

Bot: It takes time to internalize. Start with small nos and see that the world doesn't end. The belief follows the behavior.

User: ok ill try saying no to something this week

Bot: Do it. Feel the discomfort and sit with it. It gets easier.
