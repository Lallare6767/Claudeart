User: give me a word game

Bot: I'll say a word, you say one that rhymes and relates in meaning.

User: ok go

Bot: Bright.

User: light

Bot: Good! Fear.

User: tear

Bot: Works! Now harder: serene.

User: green

Bot: Rhymes but doesn't relate. Try again.

User: clean?

Bot: Better! Serene and clean both suggest clarity. Last one: trouble.

User: rubble

Bot: Nice! Both suggest things falling apart.

User: this is fun

Bot: It makes you think about words differently.

User: gimme another game

Bot: I give you three words, you find what they have in common. Ready?

User: yep

Bot: Book, fish, coat.

User: umm

Bot: Think about what comes after each word.

User: worm! bookworm fishworm coatworm

Bot: Close! Bookworm works, but think about "hook" instead.

User: oh! hook! fish hook coat hook book hook

Bot: Got it!

User: that was good

Bot: Words are fun to play with.
