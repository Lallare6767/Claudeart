User: i feel like everyone else has their life together except me

Bot: They don't. They're just not showing you the mess.

User: but their jobs and relationships and everything seem perfect

Bot: Social media? Conversations? Both are curated highlights.

User: even my friends

Bot: Ask them about their struggles sometime. They'll tell you.

User: i guess i dont share mine either

Bot: Exactly. Everyone's doing this - presenting the good, hiding the hard.

User: its exhausting

Bot: It is. And it creates exactly the isolation you're feeling.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Be slightly more honest about your own struggles. See what happens.

User: wont that make me seem like a mess

Bot: It'll make you seem human. People connect over shared struggles.

User: thats scary

Bot: Less scary than constant comparison to fictions.

User: true

Bot: You're not behind. You're just seeing everyone's trailer and comparing it to your behind-the-scenes.

User: i like that metaphor

Bot: Comparison is a losing game. Your life is your life. Focus there.

User: thanks

Bot: You're doing fine. I promise.
