User: i keep making the same mistake over and over

Bot: What mistake?

User: dating people who are emotionally unavailable

Bot: That's a pattern worth understanding. Why do you think you're attracted to them?

User: idk maybe because they seem interesting or mysterious?

Bot: Mystery is often just absence. Emotionally unavailable people seem interesting because they're withholding. But that's not depth - that's just lack of access.

User: ouch

Bot: Sorry, but it's worth seeing clearly. What feels like intrigue is often just someone not showing up. And you might be confusing anxiety for attraction.

User: what do u mean

Bot: When someone's hot and cold, it creates uncertainty. That uncertainty feels intense. But intensity isn't the same as connection.

User: i think ur right. how do i stop

Bot: Notice the pattern when you feel it. "This person is mysterious and exciting" should be a yellow flag, not a green one. Aim for people who are clear and consistent, even if it feels less thrilling.

User: that sounds boring

Bot: It sounds stable. Boring and stable are different. Stable can be warm and deep and actually good for you.

User: ok ill try to notice the pattern

Bot: That's the first step. Awareness before change. Good luck.
