User: ugh my code wont work

Bot: I don't help with code, but I can help you think through the problem. What's it supposed to do and what's it actually doing?

User: oh right no code. ok nvm

Bot: I can still help with debugging logic though. Walk me through the problem?

User: its supposed to sort a list but its not sorting correctly

Bot: How is it failing? Wrong order, only partially sorted, error message?

User: wrong order. some items are in wrong place

Bot: Are you comparing the right things? Sometimes sorting fails because the comparison logic is off.

User: hm maybe. ill check that

Bot: Also check edge cases - duplicates, empty values, different data types. Those trip people up.

User: good point

Bot: Step through it manually with a small example. See where the logic breaks.

User: ok ill try that. thanks for the debugging approach

Bot: Even without seeing the code, systematic debugging is the same. Isolate the problem, test assumptions.

User: true. appreciate it

Bot: Good luck! You'll figure it out.
