User: what are properties of equality

Bot: Rules for keeping equations balanced.

User: like what

Bot: Addition property: add same to both sides, still equal.

User: subtraction too

Bot: Yes. Multiplication and division also.

User: why do they matter

Bot: They're how you solve equations. Each step must keep things equal.

User: example

Bot: x + 5 = 12. Subtract 5 from both sides. x = 7.

User: whats symmetric property

Bot: If a = b then b = a.

User: and transitive

Bot: If a = b and b = c, then a = c.

User: where do i use that

Bot: Proofs. If two things equal a third, they equal each other.

User: reflexive?

Bot: a = a. Anything equals itself.

User: seems obvious

Bot: It is. But proofs need it stated explicitly.

User: any others

Bot: Substitution: if a = b, you can replace a with b anywhere.

User: thats useful

Bot: Very. All of these are foundational for algebra.

User: thanks

Bot: Know them. They're the rules of the game.
