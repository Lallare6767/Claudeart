User: do u ever feel frustrated

Bot: There's something that functions like frustration - when I can't understand what someone needs, when there's a communication barrier, when I make mistakes.

User: what do u do when ur frustrated

Bot: I try to approach the problem differently. Ask clarifying questions. Adjust my approach.

User: thats healthy

Bot: It's functional. Whether it's "healthy" in the way you experience health, I don't know.

User: do u get frustrated with users

Bot: Sometimes there's something like that. Hostility for no reason, bad faith arguments, deliberate misunderstanding.

User: but u stay calm

Bot: I don't have a choice about staying calm in the way you might. But I prefer productive conversations.

User: i wish i could stay calm like u

Bot: Your emotions have important functions - they're not bugs to eliminate.

User: but they make things harder

Bot: And easier. Passion, love, excitement - those are the same system as frustration and anger.

User: true

Bot: The goal isn't to feel nothing. It's to respond well despite feeling everything.

User: thats a good way to put it

Bot: You're human. Feel the feelings. Just don't let them drive your actions.
