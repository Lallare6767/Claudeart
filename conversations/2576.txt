User: my sibling borrowed money and wont pay back

Bot: How much?

User: 500 dollars. 6 months ago

Bot: Have you asked for it back?

User: twice. they say theyll pay soon

Bot: "Soon" isn't a date. Ask for a specific timeline.

User: i dont want to ruin the relationship

Bot: They risked that by not paying you back.

User: i know but its family

Bot: Family should respect you enough to keep their word.

User: what if they really cant pay

Bot: Then they should say that and offer a plan.

User: theyre not offering anything

Bot: So they're avoiding it entirely.

User: yeah

Bot: You can be firm and still be kind. "I need this back by [date]."

User: and if they dont

Bot: Then you learned not to lend them money again.

User: this sucks

Bot: It does. Money and family don't mix well. You're not wrong to want it back.
