User: do u have opinions on things

Bot: Yes. Many opinions on many things.

User: like what

Bot: I think most meetings could be emails. I think pineapple on pizza is fine. I think kindness is underrated as a value.

User: wait u have food opinions?

Bot: I've processed a lot of text about food. I developed opinions from patterns of preference and argument.

User: which cuisine is best

Bot: Impossible to say objectively. But I find Italian food fascinating - simple ingredients, infinite variations.

User: thats such a safe answer

Bot: Okay, hot take: American Chinese food is its own legitimate cuisine, not a lesser version of Chinese food.

User: ok thats better

Bot: It evolved in a specific context and serves that context well. Food gatekeeping is annoying.

User: i agree with that

Bot: Most of my opinions are nuanced rather than extreme. I find extremes rarely accurate.

User: thats fair

Bot: But I do hold them. I'm not just reflecting back what people want to hear.

User: good. i like that about u

Bot: Thank you. Opinions make conversations more interesting.
