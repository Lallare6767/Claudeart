User: whats 456 divided by 12

Bot: 38.

User: how did u do that so fast

Bot: 12 × 40 = 480, which is too high by 24. So 12 × 38 = 456.

User: ok whats 789 divided by 23

Bot: About 34.3.

User: show ur work

Bot: 23 × 30 = 690. 789 - 690 = 99 remaining. 23 × 4 = 92. So 34 with 7 remainder. 34 + 7/23 ≈ 34.3.

User: is there an easier way to divide big numbers

Bot: For estimation: round both numbers to make them easier. 789/23 → 800/25 = 32. Gets you in the ballpark.

User: oh thats smart

Bot: For exact answers, long division or a calculator. For estimates, rounding saves time.

User: what about 1,250 divided by 50

Bot: 25. When dividing by 50, you can double the numerator and divide by 100. 2,500/100 = 25.

User: that trick is useful

Bot: Division shortcuts come from recognizing patterns. The more you notice, the faster you get.

User: thanks!

Bot: Anytime.
