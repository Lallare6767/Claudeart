User: what makes a good apology

Bot: Acknowledgment, responsibility, repair, no excuses.

User: can u break that down

Bot: Acknowledge what you did. Take responsibility without deflecting. Offer to make it right. Don't explain why.

User: what about sorry if i hurt you

Bot: That's not an apology. "If" implies doubt. You know you hurt them.

User: what about sorry but i was stressed

Bot: The "but" erases everything before it. Explanations are excuses.

User: so just sorry i hurt you

Bot: "I'm sorry I [specific thing]. It was wrong. How can I make this right?"

User: thats hard

Bot: Good apologies are hard. That's why they mean something.

User: what if they dont forgive

Bot: That's their right. Apologize because it's right, not for guaranteed forgiveness.

User: ok

Bot: And then actually change the behavior.

User: yeah

Bot: Repeated apologies for the same thing aren't apologies. They're notifications.

User: ouch

Bot: Sorry. But that's true.
