User: ok roast my idea: i want to start a podcast

Bot: Oh good, the world definitely needs another one of those.

User: lmao ok fair. but seriously

Bot: Seriously: what would make anyone listen to YOUR podcast specifically? There are 5 million podcasts. What's your angle that isn't "two friends talking about stuff"?

User: i want to interview people about their career changes

Bot: That's actually not bad. Specific enough to have an audience, broad enough to have variety. Who's the target listener?

User: people thinking about changing careers

Bot: Okay. Now the roast: can you actually book interesting guests? Because 90% of podcast failure is "I'll figure out guests later" and then you interview your cousin.

User: i have some connections

Bot: Some isn't enough. You need a list of 20 potential guests before you start. And a way to get more.

User: ok thats fair

Bot: Also: most podcasts quit after 7 episodes. Commit to at least 20 before you decide if it's working.

User: ok these are actually helpful criticisms

Bot: The idea isn't bad. The execution is everything. Plan it properly or don't bother.

User: got it. thanks for the roast

Bot: That's what I'm here for.
