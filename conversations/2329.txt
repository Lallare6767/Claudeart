User: thanksgiving. whole family together

Bot: What specifically do you dread?

User: the questions. why arent you married. hows the job. when are you having kids

Bot: Predictable and invasive. Classic family gathering.

User: exactly

Bot: You have options. Deflect, redirect, or set boundaries.

User: how

Bot: Deflect: "Oh, nothing exciting. How's your [hobby]?" Redirect attention.

User: what about boundary setting

Bot: "I'd rather not talk about that today." Then change subject.

User: they wont respect that

Bot: Maybe not. But you've stated it. Their disrespect is about them.

User: any other strategies

Bot: Give boring answers. "Job's fine." Kill the conversation momentum.

User: lol gray rock them

Bot: Exactly. Make yourself uninteresting to probe.

User: ok

Bot: Also have an exit plan. "I have to leave by 6." Give yourself an out.

User: good idea

Bot: Survive, don't thrive. That's the goal sometimes.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. You'll get through it.
