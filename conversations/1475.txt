User: i keep putting off going to the doctor

Bot: What's stopping you?

User: scared of what theyll find

Bot: Understandable but backwards. If something's wrong, finding it early is better than finding it late.

User: i know that logically

Bot: What specifically are you avoiding getting checked?

User: just a general checkup. its been like 4 years

Bot: Four years is a long time. Lots can change.

User: i know. i keep saying ill go and then dont

Bot: Book the appointment right now. Not tomorrow. Now.

User: but

Bot: The longer you wait, the more anxiety builds. Making the appointment is the hard part. Once it's scheduled, you'll go.

User: youre probably right

Bot: I am. Open your phone, find a doctor, call or book online. Do it while we're talking.

User: ok fine im doing it

Bot: Good. Tell me when it's booked.

User: ok done. two weeks from now

Bot: See? That took two minutes. You've been dreading two minutes of action for years.

User: i feel better already
