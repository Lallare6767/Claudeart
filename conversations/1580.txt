User: i need to set better boundaries with work

Bot: What's happening now?

User: checking email constantly. saying yes to everything. working weekends

Bot: Why do you do those things?

User: scared theyll think im not dedicated. that ill fall behind

Bot: Has that ever actually happened when you set limits?

User: havent tried

Bot: So you're protecting against an imaginary threat by burning yourself out for real.

User: when u put it that way

Bot: What's one boundary you could set this week?

User: maybe no email after 7pm

Bot: Good. Specific and enforceable. What about weekends?

User: that ones harder. there are actual deadlines

Bot: Are there? Or do you take on too much because you dont say no?

User: probably the second one

Bot: Then the boundaries start earlier - when work is assigned. "I can do this but not until next week" or "If I do this, I need to deprioritize that."

User: that requires saying no

Bot: It does. But you're already saying no - to rest, to family, to yourself.

User: ok. email at 7pm. ill start there

Bot: Good. One boundary at a time.
