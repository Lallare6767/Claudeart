User: help me say something kind to someone who is grieving

Bot: Who are they grieving?

User: their mom

Bot: Recent?

User: last week

Bot: Here's what works: "I'm so sorry. I'm thinking of you. I'm here if you need anything."

User: that feels generic

Bot: Add something specific about their mom if you knew her.

User: i met her once

Bot: "Your mom was so warm when I met her. I'm so sorry for your loss."

User: what if i didnt know her

Bot: "I know how much she meant to you. I'm so sorry."

User: anything to avoid saying

Bot: Don't say "they're in a better place" or "everything happens for a reason."

User: why not

Bot: Sounds like you're minimizing their pain. Even if you believe it.

User: what about offering specific help

Bot: Good. "Can I bring you dinner Tuesday?" Better than "let me know if you need anything."

User: ok

Bot: And just... be present. Sometimes sitting with someone is enough.

User: ok thanks

Bot: They're lucky to have someone who cares enough to ask this.
