User: im angry at myself for wasting my weekend

Bot: What did you do that felt like wasting it?

User: nothing. literally just watched tv and scrolled

Bot: And that bothers you because...?

User: i had so many things i wanted to do

Bot: What things?

User: clean, meal prep, see friends, exercise

Bot: Ambitious list. Any reason you didn't do them?

User: just couldnt get started

Bot: That's often a sign of needing rest, not laziness.

User: but i rested all weekend and dont feel rested

Bot: Because passive rest - screens and scrolling - isn't actually restorative.

User: oh

Bot: Active rest is better. Walking, cooking, socializing. Things that engage you without draining you.

User: so i rested wrong

Bot: Maybe. Or maybe you needed the decompress but two days was too much.

User: probly the second one

Bot: Next weekend, try doing one thing from your list first. Just one. Then rest.

User: that seems doable

Bot: Momentum from small wins helps. Complete shutdown tends to breed more shutdown.

User: thanks

Bot: Don't beat yourself up too much. One lost weekend isn't a pattern yet.
