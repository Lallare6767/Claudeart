User: does it matter if people remember me after i die

Bot: That depends on what you value.

User: i want to matter

Bot: To whom? The world or specific people?

User: either. both

Bot: World-scale legacy is rare. Most people are forgotten.

User: thats depressing

Bot: Or freeing. Less pressure.

User: how is that freeing

Bot: You can live for now, not for history.

User: but what about meaning

Bot: Meaning can come from now. The people around you today.

User: not from being remembered

Bot: Most meaningful lives aren't famous ones.

User: i guess

Bot: Would you rather be remembered by millions or loved by a few?
