User: what are complementary angles

Bot: Two angles that add to 90 degrees.

User: example

Bot: 30° and 60°. 30 + 60 = 90.

User: what about supplementary

Bot: Add to 180 degrees.

User: like 90 and 90

Bot: Yes. Or 120 and 60.

User: how do i remember which is which

Bot: Complementary has C for Corner (90° is a corner). Supplementary has S for Straight (180° is a straight line).

User: oh thats good

Bot: Mnemonics help.

User: problem: angle is 35°. what's its complement

Bot: 90 - 35 = 55°.

User: and supplement

Bot: 180 - 35 = 145°.

User: easy

Bot: These show up in geometry proofs a lot.

User: proofs are hard

Bot: They're just logic chains. Each step follows from before.

User: i struggle with them

Bot: Practice. Start with simple ones. The pattern becomes clear.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Complementary and supplementary. Now you'll remember.
