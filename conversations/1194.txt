User: i feel like im wasting my life

Bot: Wasting it how?

User: just not doing anything meaningful

Bot: What would be meaningful to you?

User: idk thats the problem

Bot: Then the first step isn't to do meaningful things - it's to figure out what meaning means to you. What do you care about? What would you regret not doing?

User: i genuinely dont know

Bot: That's okay. A lot of people don't. Try things and see what engages you. Meaning is usually found through action, not thinking.

User: but what if i try things and theyre all pointless

Bot: Then you've learned something. Knowing what doesn't work for you is still progress.

User: i feel stuck tho

Bot: Stuck is just not moving. The solution is motion, not perfect direction. Pick something and do it. If it's wrong, you'll find out and adjust.

User: what if im running out of time

Bot: You're not. You have more time than you think. What you're running out of is the patience to feel stuck. Use that restlessness to actually try something.

User: ok maybe ill sign up for something

Bot: Do it. Anything. Just break the pattern of inaction.
