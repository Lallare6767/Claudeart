User: whats the quadratic formula

Bot: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

User: i can never remember it

Bot: Try the song. "X equals negative b, plus or minus the square root, of b squared minus four a c, all over two a."

User: theres a song?

Bot: Set to Pop Goes the Weasel. Look it up.

User: ok but when do i use it

Bot: When you have ax² + bx + c = 0 and can't easily factor.

User: give me an example

Bot: x² + 5x + 6 = 0. Here a=1, b=5, c=6.

User: so x = (-5 ± √(25-24)) / 2

Bot: = (-5 ± √1) / 2 = (-5 ± 1) / 2

User: so -4/2 and -6/2

Bot: x = -2 or x = -3. You could have factored this one, but formula works too.

User: when cant u factor

Bot: When the discriminant (b² - 4ac) isn't a perfect square.

User: ok this helps

Bot: Practice a few and it becomes automatic.
