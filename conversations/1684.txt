User: why do i only want ppl who dont want me

Bot: That's an extremely common pattern. It's often about what feels familiar rather than what's good for you.

User: what do u mean familiar

Bot: If your early relationships - family, childhood - involved chasing approval or love, you might be recreating that.

User: my dad was pretty distant

Bot: There it is. The distant person feels like home, even when home wasn't comfortable.

User: thats messed up

Bot: It's not your fault. It's just wiring that needs updating.

User: how do i update it

Bot: Notice when someone available feels "boring" to you. That might be healthy, not boring.

User: healthy people do feel boring

Bot: Because there's no drama, no chase. Your nervous system reads calm as dull.

User: how do i fix that

Bot: Give stable people a chance past the first few dates. Let yourself get used to not chasing.

User: that sounds hard

Bot: It is. Therapy helps enormously with this specific pattern.

User: maybe i should try

Bot: I think you should. You deserve to want people who want you back.

User: thanks

Bot: You recognized the pattern. That's the first step.
