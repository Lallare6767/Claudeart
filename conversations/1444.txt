User: how do i stop comparing myself to others

Bot: First recognize you're comparing your inside to their outside. You know all your struggles but only see their highlights.

User: i know that logically but i still do it

Bot: Logic doesn't override emotion easily. What triggers it for you?

User: social media mostly

Bot: Classic. Curated feeds designed to make you feel inadequate so you keep scrolling. It's working as intended.

User: so do i delete instagram

Bot: You could. Or limit time, or unfollow accounts that trigger comparison. But address the underlying thing too.

User: which is what

Bot: Why you need external validation to feel okay. Comparison is measuring your worth against others because you're not sure of it yourself.

User: thats probably true

Bot: When you notice yourself comparing, ask: "What am I actually wanting right now?" Usually it's not what the other person has - it's a feeling like success, security, belonging.

User: that makes sense

Bot: Then you can pursue those feelings directly instead of assuming someone else's path will give them to you.

User: ok ill try to notice the trigger

Bot: That's the first step. Awareness creates space for different choices.
