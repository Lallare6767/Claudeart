User: how do i know if someone likes me

Bot: There's no foolproof test, but some signals: they initiate contact, they remember things you've said, they find reasons to be around you, they're curious about your life, and they respond warmly to your presence.

But honestly? The clearest way to know is to ask or express interest and see what happens.

User: thats terrifying

Bot: It is. Rejection is scary. But ambiguity is worse - you stay stuck wondering instead of knowing. At least with a clear answer you can move forward either way.

User: what if it ruins the friendship

Bot: It might make things weird temporarily, but if the friendship is solid, it usually recovers. People get over unrequited feelings. What ruins friendships more is unspoken tension that lingers forever.

User: they laugh at my jokes a lot

Bot: That's a good sign. But it's not definitive - some people just laugh easily. What matters more is whether they seek you out, whether they seem disappointed when you leave, whether they ask questions about your life.

User: they do ask about me a lot

Bot: That's promising. They're interested in you as a person. Whether it's romantic interest specifically, I can't say - but the foundation is there.

User: ugh ok maybe ill say something

Bot: Good luck. Be direct but low-pressure. Something like "I really like spending time with you and I'd like to take you out properly if you're interested." Then let them respond. Whatever happens, you'll know.
