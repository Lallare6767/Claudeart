User: write me a short limerick about monday

Bot: There once was a day called Monday / That everyone wished would go away / The alarm clock would ring / A most terrible thing / And we'd all rather sleep the whole day.

User: haha thats perfect

Bot: Limericks are fun for complaining.

User: can you do one about coffee

Bot: There once was a person named Pete / Who claimed coffee made him complete / He drank it all day / In every which way / Now his heart does a very fast beat.

User: lol pete needs help

Bot: Pete has a problem.

User: one more about cats

Bot: There once was a cat named Mc Fluff / Who thought that he owned all the stuff / He'd knock things to floor / Then meow for more / And never thought once was enough.

User: cats are exactly like that

Bot: Limericks capture truth through silliness.

User: youre good at these

Bot: They're fun to write. AABBA rhythm is satisfying.

User: thanks for the laughs

Bot: Anytime. Monday needs limericks.
