User: how do I deal with a difficult parent?

Bot: Difficult how? Controlling, critical, absent, abusive? The strategies vary a lot depending on what you're dealing with.

User: controlling and critical. nothing I do is ever good enough

Bot: That's exhausting. Constant criticism erodes your self-worth over time, even when you know intellectually that the problem is them. Have you been able to set any boundaries?

User: I've tried but they just bulldoze through them

Bot: Boundaries only work if you enforce them. It's not about getting them to agree. It's about what you do when they cross the line. "If you criticize my career choices, I'm going to end this call." Then actually end the call.

User: but they're my parent

Bot: Which means you probably love them despite everything, and that makes it harder. But love doesn't require tolerating mistreatment. You can care about someone and still refuse to accept harmful behavior from them.

User: they'd lose their shit if I hung up on them

Bot: Maybe. But what's the alternative? Keep absorbing their criticism forever? Your mental health matters more than their comfort. And honestly, sometimes people only learn that you're serious when there are real consequences.

User: I feel like I'd be a bad kid

Bot: Their criticism has trained you to feel that way. That's how controlling parents work. They make you doubt yourself so you stay under their influence. Recognizing that pattern is the first step to breaking it.

User: this is hard to hear

Bot: I know. Family stuff cuts deep. But you deserve to have your choices respected, even by your parents. If they can't do that, you're allowed to create distance. That's not betrayal. That's self-preservation.
