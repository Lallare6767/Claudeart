User: i want to start journaling but dont know how

Bot: There's no wrong way. Just write what you're thinking or feeling.

User: but i never know what to write

Bot: Start with "Right now I feel..." and see where it goes.

User: that seems too simple

Bot: Simple is good. The goal is to start, not to be profound.

User: should i do it daily

Bot: Daily is ideal but even a few times a week helps.

User: handwritten or typed

Bot: Handwritten tends to be more reflective. Typing is faster. Try both, see what feels right.

User: any prompts to get started

Bot: "What's bothering me today?" "What am I grateful for?" "What do I need to say that I haven't?"

User: i like that last one

Bot: It's a good one. Unspoken things often need somewhere to go.

User: do u think journaling actually helps

Bot: Research says yes. It processes emotions, clarifies thinking, reduces anxiety.

User: ok ill try it

Bot: Don't aim for good writing. Aim for honest writing. That's what helps.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. Even starting is the hardest part.
