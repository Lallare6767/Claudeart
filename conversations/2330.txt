User: what is sine cosine and tangent

Bot: Ratios of triangle sides. SOH CAH TOA.

User: what does that mean

Bot: Sine = Opposite/Hypotenuse. Cosine = Adjacent/Hypotenuse. Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent.

User: can u draw it

Bot: Imagine a right triangle. The angle you care about has a side opposite to it and a side adjacent to it. The longest side is the hypotenuse.

User: ok

Bot: If the angle is θ, sin(θ) = opposite side ÷ hypotenuse.

User: example?

Bot: Triangle with opposite = 3, adjacent = 4, hypotenuse = 5. Sin(θ) = 3/5 = 0.6.

User: and cosine

Bot: Cos(θ) = 4/5 = 0.8.

User: tangent?

Bot: Tan(θ) = 3/4 = 0.75.

User: why do we need all three

Bot: Different problems give you different known sides. Each ratio helps depending on what you have.

User: when do u use this

Bot: Engineering. Physics. Navigation. Anything with angles and distances.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Practice with actual triangles. It clicks faster with visuals.
