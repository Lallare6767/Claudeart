User: help me write a haiku about morning

Bot: Sure. Any specific mood?

User: peaceful

Bot: Here's one: "Soft light through curtains / Coffee steam curls, disappears / Another day wakes"

User: thats nice. can i get one thats more about nature

Bot: "Dew drops catch the sun / Birds announce the coming warmth / World slowly stirs"

User: i like that one better

Bot: Nature haikus are classic for a reason.

User: can you explain the structure again

Bot: 5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables.

User: and its supposed to have nature?

Bot: Traditional haiku includes a seasonal reference. Modern ones are looser.

User: what about that season word

Bot: Called "kigo." Cherry blossoms = spring. Snow = winter. Like that.

User: so dew is summer?

Bot: Dew is usually summer or autumn.

User: cool thanks

Bot: Try writing one yourself. It's a good exercise.
