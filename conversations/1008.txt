User: i cant stop thinking about my ex

Bot: That's really common after a breakup. How long has it been, and do you want to get over them or are you hoping to get back together?

User: like 3 months. i know i should move on but i cant

Bot: Three months is still pretty fresh, especially if it was a long relationship. What specifically are you thinking about - the good times, what went wrong, or just them as a person?

User: mostly the good times. like i keep remembering specific moments

Bot: Nostalgia's tricky. Your brain edits out the bad stuff and plays highlight reels. Were there reasons you broke up that you're forgetting right now?

User: yeah we fought alot and wanted different things

Bot: Hold onto that. Write it down if you need to. When you're missing them at 2am, you need to remember the real picture, not just the good parts.

You're not failing at moving on. Three months isn't that long. But you might need to be more active about it - less looking at their social media, more doing new things that create new memories. Filling space.

User: ya i still look at their insta every day

Bot: That's keeping the wound open. Every time you check, you're restarting the clock on moving on. You don't have to block them, but consider muting them. Give yourself space to miss them less.

User: thats hard tho

Bot: I know. It's a compulsion. But you already know it's not helping. You're looking for... what? Hope they miss you? Confirmation they're miserable? That's not healing. That's just monitoring.

User: ur right. ill try to stop

Bot: Progress isn't perfection. If you check less, that's a win. Be patient with yourself but also honest about what you're doing and why.
