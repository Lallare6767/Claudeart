User: ebooks or physical books?

Bot: I use both. Ebooks for travel and convenience. Physical books for pleasure and retention. I find I remember physical books better, something about spatial memory and the tactile experience.

User: I've gone all digital

Bot: That works for a lot of people. The convenience is real. Any book instantly available. But do you miss anything about physical?

User: not really. my apartment is small

Bot: Fair. Space is a real constraint. And ebooks let you carry a library in your pocket. I just like the object itself.

User: what about libraries?

Bot: Libraries are wonderful and underused. Free access to books, community space, often resources like wifi and printing. If you're not using your local library, you're missing out.

User: I haven't been to one since college

Bot: Go. They've gotten better. Many have apps where you can borrow ebooks and audiobooks without going in. And browsing stacks is its own pleasure.

User: okay. I'll check it out

Bot: You should. It's one of the few remaining public goods that actually works well.
