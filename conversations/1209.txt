User: damn ok what does it even mean

Bot: Opposition to withdrawing state support from an established church. In England, it was about keeping the Anglican Church as the official state church.

User: so its a political position

Bot: Yes, mostly historical now. The word is famous more for being long than for its meaning.

User: whats the second longest english word

Bot: Depends how you count. "Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" is longer at 45 letters, but it was coined specifically to be long. "Antidisestablishmentarianism" is 28 letters.

User: ok spell the longer one

User: thats absurd

Bot: It's a lung disease caused by inhaling fine silica dust. Real condition, artificially lengthened name.

User: english is wild

Bot: It really is. A patchwork language with no consistency and lots of showing off.
