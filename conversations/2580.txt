User: whats the difference between weather and whether

Bot: Weather is climate conditions. Whether introduces alternatives.

User: examples

Bot: "The weather is sunny." vs "I don't know whether I'll go."

User: so whether is like if

Bot: Yes. "Whether" often means "if or not."

User: i always mix them up

Bot: Sound the same but totally different meanings.

User: any trick to remember

Bot: Weather has "eat" in it. You eat outside in nice weather.

User: thats helpful actually

Bot: Or: whether has "he" - "he wonders whether..."

User: ok i think i got it

Bot: They're common mix-ups. You're not alone.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice using both in sentences. It'll become natural.
