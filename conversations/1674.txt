User: my kid failed a test and im not sure how to react

Bot: What kind of test? And how old is the kid?

User: math test. shes 12

Bot: How did she feel about it?

User: upset. she said she studied

Bot: Did she? Do you know how she studied?

User: she said she did but maybe not effectively

Bot: That's likely. A lot of kids don't know how to actually study. They review but don't test themselves.

User: should i punish her

Bot: For failing? No. Punishment teaches her that failure is shameful, not that it's information.

User: what should i do then

Bot: Talk about what went wrong. Did she not understand the material? Not study effectively? Test anxiety?

User: probably didnt study effectively

Bot: Then help her learn how. Quiz her, don't just let her reread notes.

User: thats good advice

Bot: The goal is problem-solving, not punishment. She'll fail again if she doesn't change her approach.

User: ur right

Bot: Support her without rescuing her. She needs to own the solution.

User: thanks

Bot: She's lucky to have a parent who thinks before reacting.
