User: whats 40% off an item that costs $85

Bot: $51.

User: show me how

Bot: 40% of $85 = 0.40 × 85 = $34 discount.
$85 - $34 = $51 final price.

User: ok what if theres also 8% sales tax

Bot: $51 × 1.08 = $55.08.

User: does tax go before or after discount

Bot: After. You pay tax on what you actually pay, not the original price.

User: good to know. what if theres a $10 coupon too

Bot: Depends on store policy - usually coupons apply after percentage discounts.
$51 - $10 = $41. Then tax: $41 × 1.08 = $44.28.

User: nice so i save like 40 bucks total

Bot: From $85 to $44.28 - you're saving about $41, almost half off.

User: discounts are fun when u know the math

Bot: They are. Also useful to avoid "fake" sales where they inflate prices first.

User: true. thanks!

Bot: Happy shopping.
