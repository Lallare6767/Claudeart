User: write me a breakup text

Bot: How do you want to come across - kind, firm, short?

User: kind but clear its over

Bot: "Hey, I've been thinking a lot and I don't think this is working for me. You deserve someone who's fully in it, and I'm not feeling that way. I'm sorry. I wish you the best."

User: is that too harsh

Bot: No, it's clear. Ambiguity in breakups is crueler than honesty. They need to know it's over without false hope.

User: should i offer to talk

Bot: Only if you actually want to. Don't offer it out of guilt if you know it'll just be painful.

User: i dont want to but i feel like i should

Bot: Then don't. You can be kind without extending yourself beyond what's genuine.

User: ok maybe just the text then

Bot: That's fine. A clear text is better than a fake offer to talk that you don't want to honor.

User: thanks. this is hard

Bot: It is. But you're doing the right thing by being honest rather than stringing them along.

User: ok im gonna send it

Bot: Good luck. It's hard but necessary.
