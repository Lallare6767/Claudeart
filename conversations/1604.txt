User: i just want to scream into the void

Bot: Go ahead. What's happening?

User: EVERYTHING IS ANNOYING

Bot: Give me specifics.

User: work is chaotic, apartment has ants, car needs repairs, and my sister wont stop asking for money

Bot: That's a lot of small-to-medium problems at once. No wonder you want to scream.

User: i cant catch a break

Bot: Which one is most urgent?

User: car probably. i need it for work

Bot: Can you do anything about that today?

User: no. mechanics not open til monday

Bot: Then it's off your plate until then. What about ants?

User: bought traps already

Bot: Good. That's in progress. Your sister - have you told her no?

User: no because i feel guilty

Bot: Your money is your money. "I can't help right now" is a complete sentence.

User: ugh i know

Bot: The overwhelm is real but most of this is either in progress or requires a boundary.

User: ya when u list it out it sounds manageable

Bot: It is. Just feels like a lot because it's all at once.

User: ok. thanks for the reality check

Bot: Anytime. Scream more if you need to.
