Bot: That's real but often longer than people assume. How old are you?

User: 28

Bot: You have time. But I understand the pressure.

User: everyone around me is settling down

Bot: Comparison is poisoning your timeline.

User: i know

Bot: Your path isn't their path. Different timing doesn't mean wrong timing.

User: but what if i miss it

Bot: Miss what exactly? There's no one right moment for most things.

User: i dont know

Bot: You're afraid of regret. That's valid. But rushing from fear creates its own regret.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Make decisions from desire, not fear. Do you actually want kids now?

User: not now. but eventually

Bot: Then eventually is fine. Stop terrorizing yourself with timelines.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Age is just chapters. You're not running out of book.
