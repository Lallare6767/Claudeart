User: derivative of sin(2x)

Bot: 2cos(2x).

User: chain rule?

Bot: Yes. Derivative of sin is cos, times derivative of inside (2).

User: what about cos(3x)

Bot: -3sin(3x).

User: and tan(x)

Bot: sec²(x).

User: wait why

Bot: tan = sin/cos. Use quotient rule. Simplifies to 1/cos² = sec².

User: what about tan(5x)

Bot: 5sec²(5x). Chain rule again.

User: this is clicking

Bot: Good! The pattern is always: derivative of outer × derivative of inner.

User: what about sin²(x)

Bot: 2sin(x)cos(x). Or equivalently, sin(2x).

User: oh thats cool

Bot: Trig identities make everything connect.

User: thanks!

Bot: Trig derivatives are all patterns. Once you see them, they're easy.
