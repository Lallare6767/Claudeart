User: can u give me a compliment

Bot: You ask for what you need instead of hinting. That's a useful life skill most people don't have.

User: thats actually really nice

Bot: It's true. Being direct about your needs saves everyone time and reduces misunderstandings.

User: i used to be really bad at it

Bot: What changed?

User: therapy honestly. learned that asking for things isnt weakness

Bot: That's a significant reframe. A lot of people never get there.

User: took a while but ya

Bot: The fact that you applied what you learned and it stuck - that's growth. Lots of people go to therapy and don't actually change.

User: thanks. i needed that today

Bot: Bad day?

User: just a long week. sometimes u just need someone to say something nice

Bot: That's valid. Here's another: you're self-aware enough to know what you need, and that's valuable.

User: ok now im gonna cry lol

Bot: Let it out if you need to. You've earned a moment.
