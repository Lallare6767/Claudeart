User: what is an independent variable

Bot: The variable you change or control in an experiment.

User: and dependent

Bot: The variable you measure. It depends on the independent one.

User: example

Bot: Testing how fertilizer affects plant growth. Fertilizer is independent. Growth is dependent.

User: why those names

Bot: Dependent depends on independent. The outcome relies on what you changed.

User: how do i remember

Bot: Independent = Input. Dependent = Result.

User: what about graphing

Bot: Independent on x-axis. Dependent on y-axis.

User: why

Bot: Y depends on X. That's the convention.

User: what about control variables

Bot: Things you keep constant so they don't affect results.

User: like

Bot: Same soil, same light, same water. Only fertilizer changes.

User: so you can isolate the effect

Bot: Exactly. Good experimental design.

User: thanks this is clear now

Bot: Science is just careful questioning. Variables help you be precise.

User: cool

Bot: Practice identifying them in studies. It's a useful skill.
