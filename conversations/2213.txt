User: i got ghosted after a great date

Bot: That's confusing and hurtful.

User: yeah i dont understand

Bot: There might not be anything to understand.

User: but it went so well

Bot: It seemed to. You don't know what was happening for them.

User: so i did something wrong

Bot: Not necessarily. They might have their own stuff.

User: like what

Bot: Another person. Fear of commitment. Bad timing.

User: so its not me

Bot: Probably not. Ghosting is about the ghoster.

User: should i reach out

Bot: Once, briefly. Then leave it.

User: what do i say

Bot: "Had a great time. Would love to do it again if you're interested."

User: and if nothing

Bot: Then you have your answer.

User: thats hard

Bot: It is. But chasing someone who doesn't respond isn't worth it.

User: ok

Bot: You deserve someone who responds. This isn't that.

User: yeah

Bot: Move on. Better things ahead.

User: thanks

Bot: I'm sorry. Ghosting is cowardly.
