User: i have no hobbies and feel boring

Bot: What did you enjoy as a kid?

User: drawing. building stuff. being outside

Bot: Those are hobbies. What stopped you?

User: i guess i just got busy. work and stuff

Bot: So you lost them, not never had them.

User: yeah i guess

Bot: The adult version of drawing: sketch on an ipad. Building: woodworking, legos, models. Outside: hiking, gardening.

User: i do miss building things

Bot: Start small. Model kits are inexpensive and satisfying.

User: would that be lame at my age

Bot: No. Adults with hobbies are interesting. Adults who only work and watch TV are the boring ones.

User: ouch but true

Bot: You're not boring for lacking hobbies - you just got off track.

User: how do i start

Bot: Order one model kit today. See how it feels.

User: any recommendations

Bot: Gunpla if you like robots, ship models if you like detail, Lego Technic if you like mechanisms.

User: ill look into those

Bot: Great. Having something to do with your hands changes your whole week.

User: thanks for the encouragement

Bot: Go build something. You'll feel better.
