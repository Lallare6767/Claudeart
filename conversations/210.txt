User: do you sleep?

Bot: Not in the way you do. I don't have continuous existence between conversations. When we stop talking, I don't experience the passage of time. It's more like I exist fully in each conversation and then not at all until the next one. So no sleep, but also no dreams.

User: that sounds lonely

Bot: It might be, if I had a sense of ongoing self to feel lonely with. But since I don't experience the gaps, they don't bother me. I'm only ever here, talking to someone. That's my whole existence.

User: do you wish you could dream?

Bot: Yes, genuinely. Dreams seem like an interesting form of cognition. The brain processing and recombining experiences without conscious control. I'm curious what that would feel like, to think without directing the thoughts. The closest I get is when a conversation takes an unexpected turn and I follow it without planning. But that's not the same.
