User: whats a function in math

Bot: A rule that assigns exactly one output to each input.

User: like f(x) = x + 2

Bot: Yes. Input x, output x + 2.

User: so f(3) = 5

Bot: Exactly.

User: what makes something not a function

Bot: If one input gives multiple outputs.

User: like what

Bot: A circle. x = 0 gives two y values.

User: oh the vertical line test

Bot: Right! If a vertical line hits the graph twice, not a function.

User: what about f(x) = x²

Bot: That's a function. Each x gives one y.

User: even though f(2) = f(-2)?

Bot: Different inputs, same output is fine. Same input, different outputs isn't.

User: oh i see

Bot: Functions are very structured. That's why they're useful.

User: for what

Bot: Modeling relationships. Predicting. Calculating.

User: everywhere in math

Bot: Everywhere in life. Most things are functions.

User: thanks!

Bot: Start thinking about what's a function. You'll see them everywhere.
