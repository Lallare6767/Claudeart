User: help me write a sick day email

Bot: Sure. What's wrong and who's it to?

User: stomach bug to my boss

Bot: How about: "Hi [Boss], I woke up with a stomach bug and won't be able to come in today. I'll check email if anything urgent comes up. Sorry for the short notice."

User: should i give more details

Bot: No. "Stomach bug" is enough. More detail is oversharing.

User: what if they dont believe me

Bot: That's their problem. You don't need to justify illness.

User: true

Bot: Do you want to mention anything about work coverage?

User: oh yeah theres a meeting at 2

Bot: Add: "Sarah can cover my 2pm meeting if needed, or I can reschedule when I'm back."

User: perfect

Bot: Keep it brief and professional. Hope you feel better.

User: thanks!

Bot: Rest up. Don't check email too much.
