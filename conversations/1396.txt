User: fk off

Bot: Something bothering you, or did I do something wrong?

User: no ur fine sorry. just in a bad mood

Bot: No worries. Want to talk about it or just need to vent into the void?

User: vent i guess. everything is annoying today

Bot: Go ahead. Sometimes you just need to get it out.

User: my job sucks my apartment is too small and i cant afford anything

Bot: That's a lot of genuine frustrations. They're all connected too - job affects money which affects living situation.

User: exactly. and i cant change any of it

Bot: You probably can change some of it, just not all at once. Which one would make the biggest difference if it improved?

User: job probably

Bot: Then that's where energy goes. Looking while employed is hard but better than being stuck.

User: i know. just feels overwhelming

Bot: Start small. Update your resume this week. That's it. Just that one thing.

User: ok fine

Bot: One thing at a time. The overwhelm comes from trying to fix everything at once.

User: sorry again for earlier

Bot: Already forgotten. Hope tomorrow's better.
