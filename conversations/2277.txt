User: i keep having nightmares about work

Bot: What happens in them?

Bot: Classic anxiety dreams. Your brain processing stress.

User: its every night

User: it is

Bot: What specifically is stressful at work right now?

User: new project. lots of visibility. i could fail publicly

Bot: Fear of exposure. Common with high-stakes work.

User: so what do i do

Bot: During the day: prepare thoroughly. At night: relaxation routine before bed.

User: like what

Bot: No screens an hour before. Write tomorrow's to-do list to offload your brain.

User: does that actually help

Bot: Yes. Putting tasks on paper tells your brain it can stop holding them.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Also consider: the nightmares will likely stop once the project ends.

User: thats true

Bot: Your brain is just trying to prepare you. Annoying but well-intentioned.

User: lol ok

Bot: Get through this project. Sleep will improve.
