User: i feel like im falling behind in life

Bot: Behind what?

User: everyone else. my friends are all further along

Bot: Further along toward what goal?

User: careers. relationships. money

Bot: Those are their goals. Are they yours?

User: i guess

Bot: Do you actually want those things, or do you want to not feel behind?

User: i dont know

Bot: Important distinction. Chasing someone else's milestones makes you miserable.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Figure out what you actually want. Not what you're supposed to want.

User: how

Bot: If no one could see your life, what would you do with it?

User: travel. make art. work less

Bot: None of those are on the standard "ahead" checklist.

User: no

Bot: Then you're not behind. You're on a different path.

User: but it doesnt feel legitimate

Bot: Because society doesn't validate it. That doesn't make it wrong.

User: ok

Bot: Your life. Your definition of ahead.

User: thanks

Bot: Stop comparing your path to theirs. They're going somewhere else.
