User: how do i get out of my comfort zone

Bot: What specifically do you want to do that feels uncomfortable?

User: meet new people. go to events alone

Bot: Good targets. Those are social fears, which respond well to exposure. You just have to do them scared.

User: but i freeze up

Bot: That's anxiety. The goal isn't to not feel it - it's to act despite it. The freezing decreases with repetition.

User: so just force myself

Bot: Kind of. But frame it differently: one small step at a time. Go to an event, stay 20 minutes, leave. That's success.

User: what if i dont talk to anyone

Bot: Then you practiced being in the room. Next time you try to talk to one person. Build incrementally.

User: it sounds so simple when u say it

Bot: It is simple. It's not easy. But the steps are clear.

User: any tricks for starting conversations

Bot: Ask people about themselves. "How do you know the host?" or "What brought you here?" People like talking about themselves and it takes pressure off you.

User: ok maybe ill try an event this week

Bot: Do it. Set a low bar - just show up. You can always leave. But show up.

User: ok. thanks for the push

Bot: You've got this. Discomfort is temporary; growth is permanent.
