User: whats the pythagorean theorem

Bot: a² + b² = c² where c is the hypotenuse (longest side) of a right triangle and a and b are the other two sides.

User: give me an example

Bot: A triangle with sides 3 and 4:
3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5²

So the hypotenuse is 5.

User: whats 5-12-?

Bot: 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13²

So 5-12-13.

User: and 8-15-?

Bot: 8² + 15² = 64 + 225 = 289 = 17²

So 8-15-17.

User: how do i find the other side if i know hypotenuse

Bot: Rearrange: a² = c² - b²

If c = 10 and b = 6:
a² = 100 - 36 = 64
a = 8

So 6-8-10.

User: ok this is coming back to me now

Bot: The theorem is just one formula. Memorize it and you can solve any right triangle.

User: thanks for the geometry review

Bot: Anytime. Pythagorean theorem is one of the most useful things from high school math.
