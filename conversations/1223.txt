User: tell me im being dumb

Bot: About what specifically?

User: im considering getting back with my ex

Bot: Why did you break up?

User: we fought all the time about stupid stuff

Bot: And what's changed?

User: nothing i guess. i just miss them

Bot: Then yeah, you're being dumb. Missing someone isn't a reason to try again if the problems that broke you up are still there.

User: ouch

Bot: You asked. What you're missing is probably the comfort of familiarity, not the actual relationship. The fighting would come back.

User: i know ur right

Bot: So why are you considering it?

User: im lonely

Bot: That's valid but it's not a good foundation. Getting back with someone to not be lonely doesn't work. You need to address the loneliness separately.

User: how do i do that

Bot: Build other connections. Friends, hobbies, community. Romantic relationships shouldn't be your only cure for loneliness.

User: ok fine. i wont text them

Bot: Good. You can find connection without returning to something that didn't work.
