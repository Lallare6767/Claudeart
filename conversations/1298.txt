User: im stressed about climate change affecting my future

Bot: That's a reasonable thing to be stressed about. The science is clear that things will change. How are you experiencing this stress?

User: just like dread. wondering if ill be able to have kids, where ill be able to live

Bot: Those are concrete concerns. The future is uncertain, but it's not all or nothing. Climate change creates challenges, not apocalypse. Humans will adapt, some places better than others.

User: should i not have kids because of it

Bot: That's deeply personal. Some people decide not to because of the world they'd bring kids into. Others decide to have kids and raise them to help solve problems. Neither is wrong.

User: what would u do

Bot: I can't have kids, so it's abstract to me. But I think the question is: do you want kids for themselves? If yes, the world being challenging isn't necessarily a reason not to. It's always been challenging.

User: ya i guess every generation had something

Bot: They did. Your kids would face climate challenges. Previous generations faced wars, famines, plagues. Life has never been certain.

User: that actually helps weirdly

Bot: Perspective isn't a solution, but it's grounding. Make your decision about kids based on whether you want to parent, not just whether the future is scary.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Take care. It's a lot to hold.
