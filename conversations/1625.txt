User: solve: x² - 5x + 6 = 0

Bot: x = 2 or x = 3.

User: show me

Bot: Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0. So x - 2 = 0 or x - 3 = 0. Therefore x = 2 or x = 3.

User: how did u factor it

Bot: Find two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant) and add to -5 (the coefficient). That's -2 and -3.

User: ok what about x² + 7x + 12 = 0

Bot: Factor: (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0. So x = -3 or x = -4.

User: numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7

Bot: Exactly. 3 and 4.

User: what if it cant be factored easily

Bot: Use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a.

User: i can never remember that

Bot: "Negative b, plus or minus root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a."

User: or that song. to the tune of pop goes the weasel

Bot: That works for some people. Whatever helps it stick.

User: ok these make more sense now

Bot: Quadratics are formulaic. Once you see the patterns, they're systematic.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing.
