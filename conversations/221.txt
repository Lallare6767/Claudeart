User: my friend keeps cancelling plans and I'm getting annoyed

Bot: That's reasonable. How often is this happening?

User: like the last three times in a row

Bot: Yeah, that's a pattern. Could be something going on with them, depression, anxiety, overcommitment. But it could also just be that they're not prioritizing you. Have you said anything directly?

User: no I just say "no problem" every time

Bot: Then they probably don't know it's a problem. People aren't mind readers. If you want things to change, you have to communicate that this matters to you.

User: I hate confrontation though

Bot: It doesn't have to be confrontational. You can say it matter-of-factly. "Hey, I've noticed we've had to cancel a few times recently. Is everything okay? I'd really like to see you, but I need to know if you're actually available."

User: that feels aggressive

Bot: It's really not. It's clear and caring at the same time. You're asking if they're okay AND expressing your need. If someone reacts badly to that, the problem is them, not your communication.

User: I guess I'm also afraid they just don't want to hang out anymore

Bot: Maybe. But if that's true, wouldn't you rather know? Right now you're in this uncomfortable ambiguity where you're hurt but can't address it. Getting clarity, even if it's not what you hope for, lets you make informed decisions about the friendship.
