User: i think i self sabotage alot

Bot: What makes you say that? What patterns are you noticing?

User: like whenever things r going good i do something to mess it up

Bot: That's really common. Self-sabotage usually comes from a few places:
- You don't believe you deserve good things
- Success feels unsafe because it means more to lose
- You're unconsciously replaying old dynamics

Does any of that resonate?

User: prob the first one tbh

Bot: If you don't believe you deserve good things, success creates cognitive dissonance. You subconsciously try to correct back to what feels familiar. It's protective in a twisted way - if you mess it up yourself, at least you're in control.

User: shit thats exactly it

Bot: The good news is you're recognizing the pattern, which is huge. You can't change what you can't see. The next step is catching yourself in the moment, before the sabotage.

User: but what do i do when i catch it

Bot: Notice the feeling that comes before the action. Usually fear, or unworthiness, or something like "this is too good to last." Name it. Then ask: "If I didn't believe this about myself, what would I do right now?" And try to do that instead.

User: thats hard

Bot: It is. Therapy helps a lot with this stuff because it goes deep. But even without it, awareness plus practice can shift the pattern over time.

User: maybe ill try therapy

Bot: I think you should. You're already doing the insight work - having support would accelerate it.
