User: explain fractions

Bot: Parts of a whole. Numerator over denominator.

User: whats numerator

Bot: Top number. How many parts you have.

User: and denominator

Bot: Bottom number. Total parts the whole is divided into.

User: so 3/4 means

Bot: Three out of four equal parts.

User: how do i add fractions

Bot: Same denominator: add numerators. 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4.

User: different denominators

Bot: Find common denominator first. 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6.

User: multiply fractions?

Bot: Multiply across. 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2.

User: divide?

Bot: Flip and multiply. 2/3 ÷ 4/5 = 2/3 × 5/4 = 10/12 = 5/6.

User: why flip

Bot: Division is multiplication by reciprocal. That's the rule.

User: how do i simplify

Bot: Divide numerator and denominator by common factors. 6/12 → both ÷ 6 → 1/2.
