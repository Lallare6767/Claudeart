User: AHHH im so frustrated rn

Bot: What happened?

User: everything i try to do today goes wrong

Bot: Give me an example.

User: i spilled coffee on my shirt, my computer crashed, my package got delayed, someone was rude to me

Bot: That's a cascade. None of those individually is huge, but stacking up makes you feel like the universe is against you.

User: EXACTLY

Bot: Here's the thing: this is just a bad day. It's random, not targeted. Tomorrow will likely be normal.

User: i know but im still mad

Bot: Be mad. That's fine. Just don't make decisions while you're this frustrated.

User: like what

Bot: Like sending an angry email or quitting something or picking a fight. The frustration will pass; the consequences won't.

User: ok ya thats smart

Bot: Let yourself feel it. Scream into a pillow, go for a walk, vent (which you're doing). Then let it go.

User: thanks. i needed to just yell about it

Bot: Venting is valid. Sometimes that's all you need. Tomorrow's a reset.
