Bot: This isn't confrontation. It's clarity.

User: what do i say

Bot: "Hey, I've noticed my food disappearing. Can we figure out a system?"

User: we share some stuff

Bot: Then define what's shared and what isn't. Label if needed.

Bot: "I feel frustrated when my food is gone because I budget for it."

User: ok

Bot: Good luck. Most people respond well to directness when it's respectful.
