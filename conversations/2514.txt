User: help me understand exponent rules

Bot: Several rules. Let's go through them.

User: ok

Bot: Product rule: x^a × x^b = x^(a+b). Multiply bases? Add exponents.

User: so x² × x³ = x^5

Bot: Yes. Quotient rule: x^a / x^b = x^(a-b).

User: x^5 / x² = x³

Bot: Good. Power rule: (x^a)^b = x^(ab).

User: (x²)³ = x^6

Bot: Multiply exponents. Now negative: x^-a = 1/x^a.

User: flip to denominator

Bot: Right. Zero exponent: x^0 = 1.

User: anything to zero is 1

Bot: Except 0^0 which is debated. Generally 1.

User: what about (xy)^a

Bot: = x^a × y^a. Power distributes to each base.

User: and (x/y)^a

Bot: = x^a / y^a. Same idea.

User: these are a lot

Bot: They are. Practice until automatic.

User: when do i use them

Bot: Simplifying expressions. Solving equations. Science applications.

User: thanks

Bot: Write them down. Quiz yourself. They're foundational.
