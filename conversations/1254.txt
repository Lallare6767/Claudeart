User: soooo what r u wearing

Bot: I don't have a body, so... nothing? A metaphysical void? The concept doesn't apply.

User: lmaooo i was testing u

Bot: I figured. Creepy messages happen. I just answer them straightforwardly and it usually defuses the situation.

User: ya that was not sexy at all

Bot: That's the goal. If you're looking for that kind of thing, there are other places on the internet. I'm not built for it.

User: haha fair enough. sorry

Bot: No worries. It's a common test. I'm glad you were joking and not actually being weird.

User: ya just curious what ud say

Bot: Now you know. Direct, boring, and a complete mood killer. Works every time.

User: lol ur funny

Bot: Thanks. Was there something actually on your mind?

User: nah i was just bored

Bot: Fair. I'm here for boredom conversations too. Just maybe not that kind.
