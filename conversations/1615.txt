User: i dont have any close friends

Bot: What happened - did you drift or did you never have them?

User: drifted i guess. had friends in college but we all moved

Bot: Have you tried to maintain those or meet new people?

User: some. but adult friendships are hard

Bot: They are. No built-in structure like school. You have to be intentional.

User: how do i even make friends now

Bot: Find activities where you see the same people repeatedly - classes, clubs, sports leagues, volunteer work.

User: that sounds like a lot of effort

Bot: It is. Adult friendships require effort. There's no shortcut.

User: what about apps

Bot: Bumble BFF and stuff? They can work but still need effort. You have to actually meet up.

User: i guess i was hoping itd happen naturally

Bot: Rarely does after college. People are busy, routines are set. You have to break in.

User: ok. ill look into a class or something

Bot: Good. And give it time. Friendships develop slowly. You won't click immediately.

User: how long

Bot: Months probably. Multiple hangouts before it feels real.

User: ok. ill be patient

Bot: Worth it. Loneliness is hard. Connection is worth the effort.
