User: i resent my parents

Bot: For what?

User: how they raised me. things they did

Bot: Can you be more specific?

User: they were very controlling. never let me make decisions

Bot: That affects how you operate as an adult.

User: exactly. i cant make decisions now

Bot: Do you still have a relationship with them?

User: yes but its strained

Bot: Have you talked to them about this?

User: they dont see what they did wrong

Bot: Common. Parents often can't acknowledge harm.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Work on yourself regardless of whether they change.

User: what about the resentment

Bot: It's valid but it hurts you more than them.

User: i know

Bot: You can understand their limitations without forgiving them.

User: what if i want to forgive them

Bot: That's for you, not them. When you're ready.

User: im not

Bot: Then don't. Heal at your own pace.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You didn't deserve what happened. And you can still heal.
