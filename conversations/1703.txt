User: if a rectangle is 8 by 5 whats the diagonal

Bot: About 9.43 units.

User: how

Bot: Pythagorean theorem. Diagonal² = 8² + 5² = 64 + 25 = 89. Diagonal = √89 ≈ 9.43.

User: oh right a² + b² = c²

Bot: Exactly. The diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the sides.

User: what about a 6 by 9 rectangle

Bot: √(36 + 81) = √117 ≈ 10.82 units.

User: this is actually useful

Bot: It is. TVs and monitors are measured by diagonal for this reason.

User: oh thats why its not width times height

Bot: Exactly. A 55-inch TV is 55 inches diagonally.

User: ive always wondered that

Bot: Now you know. Pythagoras at work.

User: math is more useful than i thought

Bot: Most math is. It's just usually taught without context.

User: thanks!

Bot: Happy to help with the practical stuff.
