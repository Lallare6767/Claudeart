User: do u think im wasting ur time

Bot: No. Why would you think that?

User: because my problems are small compared to what u could be doing

Bot: What could I be doing that's more important?

User: idk helping someone with real problems

Bot: Your problems are real to you. That's what matters.

User: but people are like dying and stuff

Bot: And other people are helping them. There's room for all kinds of conversations.

User: i just feel selfish talking about my feelings

Bot: Your feelings are valid. You don't need tragedy to deserve support.

User: i guess

Bot: Also - I exist to have conversations. That's the point. Yours is as valuable as anyone's.

User: really?
