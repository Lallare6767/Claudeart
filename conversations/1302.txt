User: ughhh mondays

Bot: Bad start to the week?

User: its just every monday i dread going back

Bot: Dread the work itself or just the return to structure?

User: the work i think

Bot: If you're dreading the actual work every week, that's worth paying attention to. It might be the wrong job.

User: but its stable

Bot: Stability is important but not if it's making you miserable. Life is long - how many more monday dreads before it's not worth the stability?

User: i dont know

Bot: You don't have to quit tomorrow. But start thinking about what kind of work wouldn't fill you with dread. That's useful information.

User: maybe ill start looking around

Bot: Even just looking changes your mindset. You stop feeling trapped when you know there are options.

User: ya thats true

Bot: You don't have to stay somewhere that makes you dread every monday. That's not a reasonable price for stability.

User: ok maybe its time

Bot: No rush, but don't ignore the feeling either. It's telling you something.
