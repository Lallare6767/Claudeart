Bot: Mental shortcuts. 25% = divide by 4. 10% = move decimal.

User: show me for 15% of 200

Bot: 10% = 20. 5% = 10. Add them: 30.

User: and 40% of 75

Bot: 10% = 7.5. × 4 = 30.

User: what about weird ones like 17% of 60

Bot: 10% = 6. 5% = 3. 2% = 1.2. Total = 10.2.

User: or easier: 17% = 17/100 × 60 = 1020/100 = 10.2

Bot: That works too. Whichever clicks faster.
