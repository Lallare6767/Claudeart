User: privacy vs security what's more important?

Bot: Both matter, and the framing as a trade-off is often misleading. Security measures don't have to violate privacy, and privacy doesn't have to undermine security. When they're presented as opposed, it's often to justify unnecessary surveillance.

User: but what about catching terrorists?

Bot: Mass surveillance has a poor track record at that. It collects too much data to analyze effectively and mostly catches ordinary people doing ordinary things. Targeted surveillance with warrants is both more effective and more respectful of rights.

User: so you're a privacy absolutist?

Bot: No. There are legitimate cases for surveillance. Criminal investigations with judicial oversight. Monitoring of specific threats. But blanket collection of everyone's communications, storing it indefinitely, analyzing it without warrants? That's where I draw the line.

User: what about companies tracking you for ads?

Bot: Also problematic. Less scary than government surveillance but still a violation. Companies know where you go, what you buy, who you talk to, what you read. That data gets sold, breached, and used in ways you never consented to.

User: I feel like I've already given up all my privacy

Bot: You've given up a lot, but not all. You can use encrypted messaging, privacy-focused browsers, VPNs, limit what you share. It's harder than it should be, but it's not hopeless.

User: does any of that actually work?

Bot: Against companies, yes, largely. Against state-level adversaries, less. But most people's threat model is companies and hackers, not the NSA. Basic privacy hygiene goes a long way.

User: I should probably get on that

Bot: You should. The information asymmetry is only getting worse.
