User: i just learned something terrible about someone i admired

Bot: That's disillusioning. What happened?

User: turns out they did some really bad stuff. its been all over the news

Bot: Can you still appreciate what they created or is it ruined?

User: i dont know. it feels tainted

Bot: Art from flawed people - it's a hard question. No right answer.

User: can u separate art from artist

Bot: Some people can, some can't. It depends on what the art means to you and what the person did.

User: i really loved their work

Bot: The work still exists. The feelings it gave you were real.

User: but now i feel stupid for admiring them

Bot: You admired what they showed you. You're not responsible for what they hid.

User: should i stop engaging with their work

Bot: Your call. Some people can still enjoy it. Others can't. Neither is wrong.

User: this sucks

Bot: It does. Broken pedestals hurt.

User: do u think people are all good or all bad

Bot: Neither. Most people are complicated. Good people do bad things. Bad people do good things.

User: i guess i wanted heroes

Bot: We all do. But real people will always disappoint if you need them to be perfect.

User: thanks for listening

Bot: Take time to sit with it. There's no rush to figure out how to feel.
