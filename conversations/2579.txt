User: how do you simplify fractions

Bot: Find the greatest common factor of numerator and denominator. Divide both by it.

User: example

Bot: 8/12. GCF of 8 and 12 is 4. Divide both: 2/3.

User: how do i find gcf

Bot: List factors of each number. Find the biggest one they share.

User: factors of 8

Bot: 1, 2, 4, 8.

User: factors of 12

Bot: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.

User: so 4 is biggest shared

Bot: Correct. That's your GCF.

User: another example

Bot: 15/25. Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15. Factors of 25: 1, 5, 25.

User: gcf is 5

Bot: Right. So 15/25 becomes 3/5.

User: what if theres no common factor

Bot: If GCF is 1, fraction is already simplified.

User: oh ok

Bot: Practice finding GCFs. It becomes automatic.
