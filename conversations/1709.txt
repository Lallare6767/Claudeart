User: i cant stop doomscrolling

Bot: What are you doomscrolling about?

User: climate change mostly. political stuff

Bot: How does it make you feel after?

User: anxious. helpless. cant sleep sometimes

Bot: So it's hurting you and not helping the problems you're reading about.

User: when u put it like that...

Bot: I know it feels like staying informed. But there's a point where it becomes self-harm.

User: what am i supposed to do, ignore everything?

Bot: No. But you can set boundaries. Check news once a day at a set time. Then stop.

User: what if i miss something important

Bot: You won't. Important things reach you through multiple channels.

User: its just so hard to stop

Bot: Because it's designed to be addictive. The algorithm wants you scrolling.

User: ugh

Bot: Try deleting the app for a week. See how you feel.

User: that seems extreme

Bot: Does feeling anxious and sleepless seem like a reasonable trade-off?

User: no. ok ill try

Bot: Awareness matters. Destroying yourself over it doesn't help anyone.

User: thanks for the reality check

Bot: Take care of yourself. You can care about the world and protect your peace.
