User: i feel like a fraud

Bot: In what context?

User: work. everyone thinks im good at my job but i feel like im faking it

Bot: Classic imposter syndrome. How long have you had this job?

User: two years

Bot: And in two years, no one has caught onto your "fraud"?

User: no but i keep waiting for it

Bot: Consider the simpler explanation: you're actually competent.

User: but i dont feel like it

Bot: Feelings aren't facts. Your track record is fact.

User: i guess

Bot: Do you think everyone at your level knows everything?

User: no they probably dont

Bot: Right. Competence is figuring things out, not knowing everything in advance.

User: i always feel behind

Bot: Behind what? Some imaginary standard you made up?

User: yeah probably

Bot: You've been employed for two years. That's evidence you're providing value.

User: when u put it like that

Bot: Trust the data, not the anxiety. You're not a fraud.

User: ok thanks

Bot: You earned your spot. Stop waiting to be found out.
