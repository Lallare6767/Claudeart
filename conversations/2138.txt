User: how do i tell a story well

Bot: Structure, conflict, specificity.

User: break that down

Bot: Beginning establishes normal. Middle disrupts it. End resolves or transforms.

User: and conflict

Bot: There must be something at stake. Tension. Problem to solve.

User: specificity?

Bot: Details make stories believable. Not "a dog" but "a three-legged husky."

User: what about when telling stories about my life

Bot: Same rules. But also: know your point before you start.

User: what do u mean

Bot: Why are you telling this story? What do you want them to feel or understand?

User: i just ramble

Bot: That's the problem. No destination = no satisfaction.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Ask yourself: what's the ending? Then cut everything that doesn't get there.

User: be ruthless

Bot: Yes. Every detail should earn its place.

User: what about pacing

Bot: Slow for tension. Fast for excitement. Vary it.

User: ok

Bot: And practice. Tell the same story to different people. It improves.

User: thanks

Bot: Good stories are edited. Even true ones.
