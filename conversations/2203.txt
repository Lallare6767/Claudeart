User: i cant shake this sadness

Bot: How long have you been feeling this way?

User: weeks

Bot: Is it about something specific or just... there?

User: just there

Bot: Persistent sadness without clear cause could be depression.

User: i dont want to label it

Bot: The label isn't for judgment. It's for treatment.

User: i dont need treatment

Bot: Maybe not. But if it's been weeks, it's worth considering.

User: i should just feel better

Bot: That's not how it works. Sometimes you need help.

User: i dont want to be weak

Bot: Seeking help isn't weak. Fighting through alone often is stubbornness.

User: ouch

Bot: Would you tell a friend with a broken leg to just walk it off?

User: no

Bot: Brain chemistry is no different from any other body part.

User: i guess

Bot: At least talk to someone. A doctor. A therapist.

User: ok ill think about it

Bot: Don't just think. Do.

User: ok

Bot: The sadness doesn't have to win.
