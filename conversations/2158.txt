User: what is the midpoint formula

Bot: ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2).

User: so its just the average

Bot: Exactly. Average the x's, average the y's.

User: find midpoint of (2, 4) and (6, 10)

Bot: ((2+6)/2, (4+10)/2) = (4, 7).

User: and (0, 0) and (8, 6)

Bot: (4, 3).

User: easy

Bot: What about finding the endpoint if you know midpoint?

User: how

Bot: If (2, 3) is midpoint and one endpoint is (0, 1), find the other.

User: um work backwards

Bot: Right. (2, 3) = ((0+x)/2, (1+y)/2). So x = 4, y = 5.

User: endpoint is (4, 5)

Bot: Perfect. Just algebra.

User: what about distance formula

Bot: √((x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²). Basically Pythagorean theorem.

User: makes sense

Bot: Midpoint = average, distance = Pythagorean. They pair well.

User: thanks!

Bot: Coordinate geometry is just geometry with numbers.
