User: solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22

Bot: 3x = 22 - 7
3x = 15
x = 5

User: ok now 5(x - 2) = 35

Bot: 5x - 10 = 35
5x = 45
x = 9

User: what about 2x + 3 = x + 8

Bot: 2x - x = 8 - 3
x = 5

User: ok harder: (x + 3)/4 = 5

Bot: x + 3 = 20
x = 17

User: one more: 2(3x - 1) = 4(x + 3)

Bot: 6x - 2 = 4x + 12
6x - 4x = 12 + 2
2x = 14
x = 7

User: damn ur good at this

Bot: Algebra is mechanical once you know the moves. Get the x terms on one side, numbers on the other, simplify.

User: ya its starting to click

Bot: Good. Practice until it's automatic. The thinking part goes away once the process is memorized.

User: thanks for the help

Bot: Anytime. Keep practicing.
