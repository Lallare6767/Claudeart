User: and 8.5% of 200

Bot: 17

User: if i leave a 20% tip on a $73 bill how much is the tip

Bot: $14.60

So total would be $87.60.

User: is 20% a good tip

Bot: For sit-down restaurant service in the US, 20% is standard for good service. 15% for okay, 18% for decent, 20%+ for great.

User: what about coffee shops

Bot: Tipping at coffee shops is more optional. A buck or so on a coffee is nice but not expected. The tip jars are hopeful, not obligatory.

User: i always feel guilty

Bot: You don't need to. For counter service, tipping is a bonus, not a requirement. Save the 20% for full service.

User: ok that makes me feel better

Bot: Tipping culture is confusing. The general rule: if they're serving you at a table, 20%. If you're grabbing something at a counter, tip what you want or nothing.

User: ok cool. thanks for the math and tip advice

Bot: Two for one.
