User: how do i find the area of a triangle

Bot: Base times height divided by 2.

User: why divided by 2

Bot: A triangle is half of a rectangle with the same base and height.

User: oh that makes sense

Bot: So if base is 10 and height is 6, area is (10 × 6) / 2 = 30.

User: what if i dont know the height

Bot: Then you need other methods. Do you know all three sides?

User: yes. 5, 6, and 7

Bot: Use Heron's formula.

User: whats that

Bot: First find semi-perimeter: (5+6+7)/2 = 9.

User: ok

Bot: Then area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = √[9×4×3×2] = √216 ≈ 14.7

User: thats complicated

Bot: It is. That's why knowing the height is easier.

User: ill stick with base times height

Bot: Good call for most problems.
