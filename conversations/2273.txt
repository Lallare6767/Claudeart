Bot: Before what?

User: before everything got complicated

Bot: What specifically changed?

User: i used to be carefree. now im always worried

Bot: Awareness often comes with worry. You can't unsee things.

User: i want to go back

Bot: You can't. But you can be both aware and at peace.

User: how

Bot: By accepting that worry is the price of caring. And that caring is worth it.

User: i guess

Bot: The carefree version of you didn't have what you have now.

User: like what

Bot: Knowledge. Experience. Depth. You traded lightness for substance.

User: i didnt ask for that trade

Bot: No one does. Growth isn't optional once it starts.

User: its exhausting

Bot: It is. But would you really want to go back to not knowing what you know?

User: honestly sometimes yes

Bot: That's nostalgia talking. You'd be bored within a week.

User: maybe

Bot: Be gentle with yourself. Wisdom is heavy at first.
