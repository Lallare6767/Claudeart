User: whats the difference between there their and theyre

Bot: There is location. Their is possession. They're is "they are."

User: examples?

Bot: "Put it over there." "It's their book." "They're coming later."

User: how do i remember

Bot: "Here" is in "there" - both locations. "Their" has "heir" - about owning. "They're" has apostrophe - contraction.

User: thats helpful

Bot: What about your and you're?

User: your is possessing. youre is you are

Bot: Good. And its vs it's?

User: um. its is... wait

Bot: Counterintuitive. "Its" is possession. "It's" is "it is."

User: why no apostrophe for possessive

Bot: Because "it's" already means "it is." English made a rule exception.

User: english is weird

Bot: Very. But patterns help. Contractions always have apostrophes. Possessive pronouns never do.

User: hers his theirs its

Bot: Exactly. None have apostrophes.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Master these and your writing improves immediately.
