User: i keep choosing the wrong partners

Bot: What do you mean by wrong?

User: they turn out to be emotionally unavailable or the relationship ends badly

Bot: What draws you to them initially?

User: intensity. excitement. they seem confident

Bot: And when does it go wrong?

User: the intensity becomes inconsistency. the confidence was actually avoidance of vulnerability

Bot: You're recognizing the pattern. That's step one.

User: but i keep repeating it

Bot: Because there's something underneath that's attracted to it. Often it feels familiar - similar to dynamics from childhood.

User: probably. my dad was like that

Bot: So emotional unavailability feels normal to you. It's what love looked like growing up.

User: thats depressing

Bot: It's treatable though. Therapy can help you rewire what feels attractive to you.

User: have u suggested therapy to me before

Bot: No memory of previous conversations. But I suggest it often - it's one of the most effective tools for pattern-breaking.

User: ya i should probably go

Bot: You deserve relationships with people who are present and available.
