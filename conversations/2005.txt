User: my aunt

Bot: I'm sorry for your loss. Were you close?

User: very. she was like a second mom

Bot: That's beautiful and makes this harder.

User: what do i say

Bot: Start with who she was to you. Then one specific story that captures her. Then what she taught you.

User: what if i cry

Bot: You will. That's okay. Take pauses.

User: i dont want to break down

Bot: Bring water. Pause when needed. People will wait.

User: how long should it be

Bot: 3-5 minutes. Short and meaningful beats long and rambling.

User: can u help me write it

Bot: Tell me about her. One moment that shows who she was.

User: she always made you feel like the most important person in the room

Bot: Start there. "My aunt had a gift - she made everyone feel like the most important person in the room." Then give an example.

User: ok. thank you

Bot: She'd be proud of you for doing this.
