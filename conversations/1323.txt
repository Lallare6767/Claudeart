User: what should i say to someone who lost a loved one

Bot: Less than you think. "I'm so sorry for your loss" and "I'm here for you" are enough. Avoid trying to explain or comfort - just be present.

User: what shouldnt i say

Bot: Don't say: "They're in a better place," "Everything happens for a reason," "I know how you feel," or "At least they're not suffering." These minimize the loss or make it about you.

User: i always feel like i should say something meaningful

Bot: Presence matters more than words. A hug, sitting with them, bringing food, checking in later - those are more helpful than the perfect thing to say.

User: what about later on

Bot: Keep reaching out after the first week. Everyone floods them initially and then disappears. Be the person who's still checking in a month later.

User: i never thought about that

Bot: Grief doesn't end after the funeral. The lonely part comes after, when everyone goes back to their lives.

User: should i bring up the person who died

Bot: Usually yes. Grieving people often want to talk about them but worry others don't want to hear it. Saying "Tell me about them" is a gift.

User: ok this is really helpful

Bot: Just show up and be kind. You don't have to be perfect - just present.
