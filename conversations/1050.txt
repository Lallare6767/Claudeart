User: whats a good way to end a thank you card

Bot: Depends on the relationship and how formal it is. Some options:

**Warm but professional:**
- With gratitude,
- Many thanks,
- Warmly,

**Casual/personal:**
- Thanks again!
- So grateful,
- XOXO (if appropriate)

**Formal:**
- Sincerely,
- With appreciation,
- Respectfully,

Who's the card for?

User: my aunt who gave me a graduation gift

Bot: For family who gave you a gift, I'd go with:

"With love and gratitude,"
or
"Thanks again for everything! Love,"

Warm but still meaningful for the occasion.

User: thanks. also can u give me a line for the actual thank you part

Bot: Sure! Here's something you could write:

"Thank you so much for the generous graduation gift. It means a lot to know you're celebrating this milestone with me. I'm excited to use it toward [college expenses/my new apartment/whatever fits]."

Specific + genuine = good thank you.

User: perfect. ur saving me so much time

Bot: That's what I'm here for. Your aunt will appreciate the note regardless, but it's nice to make it personal.
