User: i think my therapist isnt right for me

Bot: What's making you feel that way?

User: i just dont feel like im getting anywhere

Bot: How long have you been seeing them?

User: 3 months

Bot: That's enough time to evaluate. What specifically isn't working?

User: they just kinda listen and nod but i dont feel challenged

Bot: Some therapists are more active and some are more reflective. Sounds like you need a more active approach - CBT or directive styles rather than psychodynamic.

User: i didnt know there were different types

Bot: Definitely. Ask your therapist to try different techniques, or look for someone who practices CBT or solution-focused therapy. You want someone who gives you tools, not just space.

User: is it rude to switch

Bot: Not at all. Therapist fit matters. A good therapist would understand. You're not obligated to stay with someone who isn't helping.

User: ok maybe ill look for someone else

Bot: Do it. Therapy only works if the approach matches your needs. Three months without progress is a signal.

User: thanks for validating that

Bot: Trust your instincts. If it's not working, it's not working.
