User: i feel like i dont fit in anywhere

Bot: Fit in where - with friends, at work, in general?

User: in general. like im always a little outside every group

Bot: That's more common than you think. A lot of people feel that way but don't say it because they think everyone else fits in perfectly.

User: it feels lonely tho

Bot: It can be. Are you looking for belonging or just feeling the lack of it?

User: both i guess

Bot: Have you found any communities around specific interests? Sometimes fitting in isn't about general social belonging but about shared passion.

User: not really

Bot: Try that. Find people who care about the same weird specific things you do. Those connections often feel more real than general friendships.

User: like what

Bot: Whatever you're into - hobbies, games, books, causes. There are communities for everything. You just have to find them and show up.

User: i guess i could try

Bot: The not fitting in feeling might never fully go away. But finding people who get you - even just a few - makes it much more bearable.

User: ya that would be nice

Bot: It's out there. You just have to look.
