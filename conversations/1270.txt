User: convert 60 mph to km/h

Bot: About 96.6 km/h. (Multiply by 1.609.)

User: and 100 km/h to mph

Bot: About 62.1 mph. (Divide by 1.609.)

User: why is the conversion factor so weird

Bot: Because miles and kilometers were defined independently. Miles come from Roman mille passus (thousand paces). Kilometers are based on the Earth's circumference divided by 40,000.

User: so neither is better

Bot: Metric is better for calculations because it's base 10. But if you grew up with miles, they feel intuitive. It's just what you're used to.

User: can u do celsius to fahrenheit

Bot: Sure. What temperature?

User: 25 celsius

Bot: 77°F. Formula: (C × 9/5) + 32.

User: and 100 fahrenheit

Bot: About 37.8°C. Formula: (F - 32) × 5/9.

User: ok one more: how many feet in a meter

Bot: About 3.28 feet. Or roughly 3 feet 3 inches.

User: cool thanks

Bot: Anytime. Unit conversions are just multiplication - the hard part is remembering the factors.
