User: spell check: accomodate

Bot: Incorrect. It's "accommodate" - two c's and two m's.

User: ugh i always get that wrong. how about occurence

Bot: Also incorrect. It's "occurrence" - two c's and two r's.

User: why are these so hard

Bot: Double letters are tricky because pronunciation doesn't help. You have to memorize them.

User: any others i should know

Bot: Common ones: definitely (not definately), separate (not seperate), receive (not recieve), weird (exception to i-before-e).

User: separate gets me too

Bot: Think "there's a rat in separate." The a's surround the rat.

User: lol ok. what about embarrass

Bot: Two r's and two s's. "Really red, so shy."

User: these mnemonics help

Bot: They do. English spelling is inconsistent so tricks are necessary.

User: what word is most commonly misspelled

Bot: "Accommodate" is up there. Also "millennium" (two l's and two n's) and "minuscule" (not "miniscule").

User: ok im gonna practice these

Bot: Good plan. Once you learn them they stick.

User: thanks!

Bot: Anytime.
