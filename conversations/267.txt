User: is digital art as valid as traditional art?

Bot: Yes. The medium doesn't determine validity. Art is about expression, communication, skill, and creativity. Digital tools are just different from oil paints or charcoal. None of those things are inherently more "real."

User: but digital artists have undo buttons

Bot: So what? Traditional artists can paint over mistakes. Having tools that make process easier doesn't reduce the value of the outcome. By that logic, acrylics are less valid than oils because they dry faster.

User: I feel like there's more skill in traditional though

Bot: Different skills. Digital art requires understanding of software, color management, layers, brushes. Traditional requires understanding of physical materials, texture, drying times. Both have depth. You can spend a lifetime mastering either.

User: I'm a traditional artist and I feel threatened by digital I guess

Bot: That's understandable. Digital art has expanded who can make art and how quickly. But it hasn't replaced traditional. Collectors still value oil paintings. Galleries still show physical work. Both coexist.

User: should I learn digital?

Bot: Only if you want to. It opens commercial opportunities and speeds up certain workflows. But if you love the physicality of paint and canvas, that's reason enough to stay with it. Follow what draws you, not what seems strategic.

User: yeah I really do love paint

Bot: Then keep painting. Your work will have something digital art can't replicate. The texture, the evidence of process, the object itself. That matters to a lot of people.
