User: whats a coefficient

Bot: Number multiplied by a variable.

User: in 3x?

Bot: 3 is the coefficient.

User: what if theres no number

Bot: It's 1. x = 1x.

User: what about -5y

Bot: Coefficient is -5. Includes the sign.

User: constants too?

Bot: Constants are numbers without variables. Different from coefficients.

User: in 3x + 7

Bot: 3 is coefficient. 7 is constant.

User: what about 4x² + 2x - 5

Bot: Coefficients: 4 and 2. Constant: -5.

User: why do they matter

Bot: They scale the variable. Bigger coefficient = bigger impact.

User: like in graphing

Bot: Yes. Coefficient of x is slope in linear equations.

User: and in quadratics?

Bot: Coefficient of x² affects how wide/narrow parabola is.

User: so they shape the graph

Bot: Exactly. They're not just numbers. They mean something.

User: thanks

Bot: Watch for coefficients. They tell you about behavior.
