User: what gives life meaning?

Bot: Different things for different people. Relationships, purpose, understanding, experience, creation. There's no universal answer. The question isn't what gives life meaning but what gives your life meaning.

User: I don't know what gives my life meaning

Bot: That's okay. Many people don't. It's not something you find once and keep. It evolves and requires ongoing attention. What have you been drawn to? What makes time disappear? Where do you feel most yourself?

User: I used to feel that way about music but I stopped playing

Bot: Why did you stop?

User: life got busy I guess

Bot: That's common. But if music gave you meaning and you stopped, that might be why you feel like meaning is missing. Consider picking it back up.

User: I feel like it's too late

Bot: For what? To be a professional musician? Maybe. But that's not the only reason to play. Play because it makes you feel alive. That's what meaning actually is.

User: okay. maybe I'll try

Bot: I hope you do. And I hope it helps.
