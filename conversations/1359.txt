User: wat does per capita mean

Bot: Per person. Literally "per head" in Latin.

User: so if gdp per capita is $50k

Bot: That means if you divided the country's total GDP by the number of people, each person's share would be $50,000. It's an average.

User: is that a good measure

Bot: It's useful but flawed. A country can have high GDP per capita but massive inequality - a few rich people pull up the average while most people are poor.

User: so what's better

Bot: Median income shows what the typical person makes. Gini coefficient measures inequality directly. GDP per capita plus these other measures gives a fuller picture.

User: why do people use per capita so much

Bot: It's simple and easy to compare. And for some measures (like carbon emissions per capita), it's the best way to compare countries of different sizes.

User: ok makes sense

Bot: It's not wrong to use - just incomplete. Any single number misses nuance.

User: thanks for the economics lesson

Bot: Anytime. Understanding what statistics actually mean is useful for reading the news.
