User: help with run on sentences

Bot: A run-on sentence happens when independent clauses are joined without proper punctuation.

User: example of wrong

Bot: "I went to the store I bought milk."

User: how to fix

Bot: Period: "I went to the store. I bought milk."

User: or

Bot: Comma and conjunction: "I went to the store, and I bought milk."

User: or semicolon

Bot: Yes. "I went to the store; I bought milk."

User: whats a comma splice

Bot: A type of run-on. Using just a comma: "I went to the store, I bought milk."

User: thats wrong

Bot: Yes. Comma alone can't join independent clauses.

User: how do i spot these in my writing

Bot: Read out loud. If you naturally pause for breath, you need punctuation there.

User: good tip

Bot: Also look for two complete thoughts with no connection between.

User: what makes a complete thought

Bot: Subject and verb that can stand alone. "I went" is complete. "After I went" isn't.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Run-ons are common. Fixing them makes writing clearer immediately.

User: ill practice

Bot: Good. Short sentences are your friend.
