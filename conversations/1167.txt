User: i want to learn to cook better

Bot: What can you currently make?

User: like basic stuff. eggs, pasta, grilled cheese

Bot: Good foundation. What do you want to be able to make?

User: actual meals that impress people

Bot: Pick one cuisine you like eating and learn five dishes from it. Mastering a small set is better than dabbling in everything.

User: maybe italian?

Bot: Great choice. Learn: proper pasta with garlic and oil (aglio e olio), a good tomato sauce, risotto, chicken piccata, and a simple salad dressing. That's five meals plus variations.

User: where do i learn

Bot: YouTube. Serious Eats for technique explanations. Just pick recipes and cook them multiple times until they're muscle memory.

User: do i need fancy equipment

Bot: No. A sharp knife, a decent pan, and a cutting board. That's 90% of it. Equipment obsession is procrastination.

User: ok so just start cooking stuff

Bot: Exactly. Cook the same dish three times in a row. By the third time you'll know it. Then move to the next one.

User: that seems manageable

Bot: It is. Cooking isn't talent - it's just practice. Start this week.
