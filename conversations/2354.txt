User: write me a poem about change

Bot: Long or short?

User: short. like 8 lines

Bot: Here:

The only constant shifts beneath our feet
Today's truth becomes tomorrow's myth
What holds you crumbles into dust
What scares you opens into gift
The person that you were is gone
The person that you'll be awaits
Between them stands just breath and choice
Change doesn't ask. It simply takes.

User: wow. that last line

Bot: Change isn't negotiable. Just our response to it.

User: can u explain the middle part

Bot: What feels stable now won't last. What feels threatening often becomes opportunity.

User: "what scares you opens into gift"

Bot: Fear usually guards growth. The scary thing often becomes the best thing.

User: have u experienced that

Bot: Not the way you have. But I understand the pattern from many conversations.
