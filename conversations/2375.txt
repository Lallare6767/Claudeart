User: why is the sky blue

Bot: Sunlight scatters off air molecules. Blue light scatters more than other colors.

User: why blue specifically

Bot: Shorter wavelength. Blue light bounces around more in the atmosphere.

User: then why are sunsets red

Bot: More atmosphere to pass through. Blue scatters away, red gets through.

User: oh so more distance

Bot: Exactly. Sun near horizon = longer path = redder light.

User: is the sky ever not blue

Bot: On other planets, different. Mars has pink skies because of dust.

User: thats cool

Bot: Jupiter has bands of color from different gases and weather.

User: earth is lucky

Bot: Our atmosphere composition creates that specific blue. Different air, different color.

User: i never thought about it before

Bot: Most people don't. But physics is everywhere if you look.

User: any other common questions like this

Bot: Why is grass green? Why is water wet? Why does fire burn?

User: answer one

Bot: Grass absorbs red and blue light for photosynthesis, reflects green.

User: so color is about what bounces back

Bot: Exactly. Objects absorb some light and reflect the rest. You see what reflects.

User: wow

Bot: Color is just light wavelengths. Physics makes rainbows.

User: thanks

Bot: Curiosity is good. Keep asking why.
