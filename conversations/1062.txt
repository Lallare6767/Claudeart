User: im nervous about something stupid

Bot: Nervous feelings aren't stupid - they're signals. What's going on?

User: i have to give a presentation at work tmrw and its not even a big deal

Bot: Presentations make most people nervous regardless of stakes. Your brain doesn't distinguish well between real danger and social evaluation. The fear is the same.

How prepared are you?

User: pretty prepared tbh

Bot: Then you're ahead of most. The nervousness is just adrenaline. It'll actually help you be sharper. The goal isn't to eliminate nerves - it's to perform well despite them.

User: any tips?

Bot: - Practice out loud, not just in your head
- Focus on the first 60 seconds - if those go well, confidence follows
- Remember that the audience wants you to succeed - they're not looking for mistakes
- Breathe from your diaphragm, not your chest

User: ok. that helps. thanks

Bot: You'll do great. And afterwards, regardless of how it goes, notice that you survived. That memory will help next time.
