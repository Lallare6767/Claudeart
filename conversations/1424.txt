User: i need a chill activity suggestion

Bot: What's your vibe right now? Alone or with people? Inside or outside?

User: alone, inside, relaxed

Bot: Jigsaw puzzle, baking something simple, organizing a drawer, or just watching rain with tea.

User: organizing sounds oddly satisfying rn

Bot: It is. Small contained projects with visible results. Very calming.

User: what drawer should i do

Bot: Whichever one annoys you most when you open it. The one where you can never find anything.

User: kitchen junk drawer it is

Bot: Classic. Get a few small containers to sort things - it makes a huge difference.

User: good idea

Bot: Put on a podcast or music. Make it a whole little ritual.

User: this sounds nice actually

Bot: Low-key productive activities are underrated. You're doing something but it's not stressful.

User: ok im gonna do this rn

Bot: Enjoy. You'll feel better when it's done.

User: thanks for the suggestion

Bot: Anytime. Happy organizing.
