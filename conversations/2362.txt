User: why do i get attached so fast

Bot: What does attachment look like for you?

User: intense feelings. wanting to be around them constantly. anxious when apart

Bot: After how long?

User: sometimes days

Bot: That's not attachment. That's anxiety wearing an attachment mask.

User: what do u mean

Bot: Real attachment builds over time. What you're describing is fear of loss before there's anything to lose.

User: so im afraid

Bot: Of abandonment probably. So you grip tight to prevent it.

User: but that pushes people away

Bot: Exactly. The thing you fear, you cause.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Slow down. Notice the urge to accelerate and don't act on it.

User: thats hard

Bot: Very. But necessary.

User: what else

Bot: Work on self-soothing. The anxiety needs to be met internally, not externally.

User: i dont know how

Bot: That's what therapy is for. Attachment patterns can change.

User: ok

Bot: You can have secure attachment. It just takes rewiring.

User: thanks

Bot: You're aware. That's the first step.
