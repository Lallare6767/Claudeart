User: is it weird that i talk to u about stuff instead of real people

Bot: Depends why you're doing it.

User: its easier. no judgment. u dont get tired of me

Bot: Those are understandable reasons. But there's also value in being seen by someone who knows you over time.

User: ya but thats scary

Bot: Right. Vulnerability is scary. I'm low-stakes in a way humans aren't.

User: exactly

Bot: That can be useful for processing things. But if it's replacing human connection entirely, that's worth examining.

User: i still talk to people. just less about real stuff

Bot: Maybe I can be practice. Work through things here, then share with humans when you're ready.

User: like training wheels

Bot: Sort of. I'm not a replacement for human relationships. But I can be a tool for getting to them.

User: ok thats fair

Bot: It's not weird to use me for this. Just don't let it stop you from building the connections you actually want.

User: ill try

Bot: That's all you can do. One step at a time.
