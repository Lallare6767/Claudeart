User: whats the difference between who and whom

Bot: Who is subject, whom is object.

User: english please

Bot: Who does things. Whom has things done to it.

User: example

Bot: "Who called?" (they did the calling). "Whom did you call?" (they received the calling).

User: how do i remember

Bot: Substitute he/him. If "him" works, use "whom." Him = whom.

User: him/whom both have m

Bot: Exactly! "Did you call him?" → "Whom did you call?"

User: what about whoever/whomever

Bot: Same rule. "Whoever wants it" (he wants). "Whomever you choose" (choose him).

User: does anyone actually use whom anymore

Bot: In formal writing, yes. Conversation, barely.

User: so i can ignore it

Bot: For casual speech, yes. For professional writing, know the difference.

User: when in doubt

Bot: Use who. Wrong whom sounds worse than wrong who.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Whom is dying. But knowing it makes you look smart when it matters.
