User: help i need to apologize to my sister but i dont know how

Bot: What did you do?

User: i forgot her birthday completely. like didnt even text her

Bot: Ouch. How close are you two?

User: pretty close thats why its so bad

Bot: Okay. Don't over-apologize or make excuses. Just own it: "I'm so sorry I forgot your birthday. There's no excuse, I just dropped the ball and I feel terrible about it. Can I take you out to make up for it?"

User: is that enough? i feel like i need to do more

Bot: The apology plus a concrete make-up gesture (dinner, gift, whatever) is enough. What she needs to hear is that you know you messed up and you care.

User: should i explain why i forgot

Bot: Only if the reason is legitimate (major life crisis). Otherwise explanations sound like excuses. Just own it.

User: there wasnt really a reason i was just distracted

Bot: Then don't explain. "I forgot, I'm sorry, let me make it up to you." That's it.

User: ok im gonna call her now

Bot: Good luck. She'll probably appreciate that you're not trying to justify it. Just taking responsibility goes a long way.
