User: what is average speed

Bot: Total distance divided by total time.

User: so if i drive 60 miles in 2 hours

Bot: Average speed = 60/2 = 30 mph.

User: even if i went different speeds

Bot: Yes. Average is overall. Doesn't matter if you varied.

User: what about round trips

Bot: Be careful. Can't average speeds.

User: what do u mean

Bot: You go 60 mph there and 30 mph back. Average isn't 45.

User: why not

Bot: Times are different. You spend more time going slow.

User: how do i calculate it then

Bot: Total distance ÷ total time. If 60 miles each way, 1 hour there, 2 hours back.

User: 120 miles ÷ 3 hours = 40 mph

Bot: Exactly. Not 45.

User: thats counterintuitive

Bot: Famous trap. Always use distance ÷ time.

User: when do i use this

Bot: Travel planning. Race times. Productivity.

User: thanks

Bot: Remember: total distance divided by total time. Always.
