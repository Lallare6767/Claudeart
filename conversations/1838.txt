User: my friend group is falling apart

Bot: What's happening?

User: people are busy. some moved away. we never hang out anymore

Bot: Adult friendship drift. Very common.

User: it makes me so sad

Bot: That's appropriate. You're losing something important.

User: how do i stop it

Bot: You might not be able to stop it completely. But you can slow it.

User: how

Bot: Be the one who organizes. People want to hang out but no one makes plans.

User: i always have to be the one

Bot: Yes. That's the tax for maintaining friendships as adults.

User: that seems unfair

Bot: It is. But fair or not, it's how it works.

User: what if theyre not interested anymore

Bot: Then focus on the ones who show up. Quality over quantity.

User: some of them do show up

Bot: Those are your people. Invest in them.

User: ok

Bot: Friendships take maintenance. People who don't put in effort will drift. That's on them.

User: thanks

Bot: Organize something this week. See who shows up.

User: i will

Bot: Good. The group might get smaller but the real ones will stay.
