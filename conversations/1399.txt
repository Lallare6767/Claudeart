Bot: Dark liquid rising
bitter warmth cuts through the fog
morning starts to move

User: nice. now one about being tired

Bot: Heavy-lidded eyes
the pillow calls from downstairs
just five more minutes

User: lol relatable. can u do one about rain

Bot: Drops on the window
a rhythm without pattern
world washed clean again

User: ur good at this. sad one?

Bot: Empty chair at lunch
I still set two plates sometimes
habit outlasts loss

User: oh wow that one hit different

Bot: Haiku works well for emotions. The constraint focuses the feeling.

User: angry one?

Bot: Words stuck in my throat
what I should have said echoes
too late now too late

User: ok last one. hope?

Bot: Small green leaf uncurls
against all odds in concrete
life finds the crack through

User: ok im impressed

Bot: Thank you. Haiku are fun - the 5-7-5 structure forces precision.

User: these are actually really good

Bot: Constraints breed creativity. It's why forms exist.
