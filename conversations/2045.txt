User: i feel jealous of my friend's success

Bot: Which friend?

User: my best friend. they just got a huge promotion

Bot: And you're happy for them?

User: i want to be

Bot: But?

User: i feel left behind

Bot: Their success doesn't diminish yours.

User: i know that logically

Bot: Feelings aren't logical.

User: no

Bot: What specifically triggers the jealousy?

User: we started at the same place. now they're ahead

Bot: "Ahead" implies one path. Maybe you're on different ones.

User: but they have what i want

Bot: Then let their success be proof it's possible.

User: thats a good reframe

Bot: Jealousy is information. It tells you what you want.

User: i want recognition

Bot: Then pursue it. Your friend's success is irrelevant to that.

User: youre right

Bot: Celebrate them. Then work on yourself.

User: ok

Bot: Your turn will come. Unless you let jealousy poison the friendship.
