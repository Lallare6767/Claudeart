User: whats the order of operations again

Bot: PEMDAS. Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

User: multiplication before addition

Bot: Yes. And multiplication/division are equal, left to right. Same with addition/subtraction.

User: so 8 - 3 + 2 = ?

Bot: Left to right: 8 - 3 = 5, then 5 + 2 = 7.

User: not 8 - 5 = 3?

Bot: No. Addition isn't before subtraction. They're equal, so left to right.

User: ok what about 6 ÷ 2(1+2)

Bot: Famous internet debate. Parentheses first: 6 ÷ 2(3).

User: then?

Bot: Depends on interpretation. Is 2(3) multiplication or part of denominator? Convention says 6 ÷ 2 × 3 = 9.

User: not 1?

Bot: Some argue 1 due to implied multiplication priority. But standard PEMDAS says 9.

User: confusing

Bot: Ambiguous notation. Good math writing avoids this with clearer formatting.

User: so 9 is right?

Bot: By standard convention, yes. But the question is poorly written.

User: got it

Bot: PEMDAS with left-to-right for equal operations. That's the rule.
