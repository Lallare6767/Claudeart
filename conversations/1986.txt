User: i got rejected from a job i really wanted

Bot: That's painful. How are you feeling?

User: devastated honestly

Bot: Let yourself feel that. Rejection hurts.

User: i thought i nailed the interview

Bot: Sometimes it's not about you. Internal candidate, budget cuts, bad fit reasons.

User: but i wanted it so bad

Bot: Which is why it hurts. You cared.

User: what do i do now

Bot: Grieve it for a day or two. Then keep going.

User: easy to say

Bot: I know. But the only way out is through.

User: should i ask for feedback

Bot: Yes. Not all companies give it, but always ask.

User: ok

Bot: And remember - this job was "the one" until the next one that's better comes along.

User: you dont know that

Bot: You're right. But staying open to it matters.

User: ok ill try

Bot: You will find something. This wasn't it. Keep moving.

User: thanks

Bot: Take care of yourself tonight.
