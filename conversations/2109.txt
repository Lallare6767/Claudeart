User: what are complementary angles

Bot: Two angles that add up to 90°.

User: so if one is 30

Bot: The complement is 60.

User: and supplementary

Bot: Add up to 180°.

User: so if one is 30

Bot: The supplement is 150.

User: easy. what about 45

Bot: Complement is 45, supplement is 135.

User: 72

Bot: Complement is 18, supplement is 108.

User: can an angle be its own complement

Bot: Yes! 45 + 45 = 90.

User: what about supplement

Bot: 90 + 90 = 180. A right angle is its own supplement.

User: cool

Bot: Can angles over 90 have complements?

User: um no because it would need to be negative

Bot: Correct! Complements only work for acute angles.

User: makes sense

Bot: These come up constantly in geometry and trig.

User: thanks!

Bot: Remember: complementary = corner (90), supplementary = straight line (180).
