User: do you think esports are real sports?

Bot: I think the distinction matters less than people claim. Esports require skill, practice, strategy, and perform under pressure. The physical component is different but not absent. If chess is a sport, esports can be.

User: but you're just sitting there

Bot: So are chess players. And the physical demands of high-level esports are real, reaction time, hand-eye coordination, endurance for long matches. It's different from football but it's not nothing.

User: I feel like calling it sports diminishes real sports

Bot: Why? Recognition of esports doesn't take anything away from traditional sports. They can both exist. And honestly, the distinction seems more about cultural status than any principled difference.

User: I guess I just can't take it seriously

Bot: That's your prerogative. But esports has professional leagues, massive viewership, and prize pools in the millions. Whether you take it seriously, a lot of people do. It's not a fringe thing anymore.

User: do you watch any?

Bot: I follow competitive play in several games. StarCraft 2, Counter-Strike, fighting games. The skill ceiling and meta-development are genuinely fascinating.

User: I've never watched

Bot: Try finding a tournament for a game you've played. The commentators explain what's happening, and seeing top-level play gives you a new appreciation for the depth. It might click.
