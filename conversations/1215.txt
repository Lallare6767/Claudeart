User: give me some interesting questions to ask on a first date

Bot: Here are some that go deeper than "what do you do":

1. What's something you changed your mind about recently?
2. What's your relationship like with your family?
3. What's something you're really proud of that most people don't know?
4. What do you want your life to look like in five years?
5. What's something that made you happy this week?

User: those r good but some seem intense for first date

Bot: Fair. Lighter versions:

1. What's something that always makes you laugh?
2. If you could master any skill instantly, what would it be?
3. What's your favorite thing you've done this year?

User: better. any funny ones

Bot: "What's the weirdest rabbit hole you've gone down on the internet?" Or "What's a hill you'll die on that most people think is stupid?"

User: haha those r great

Bot: The goal is to get them talking about something they care about. That's when you see who they actually are.

User: ya makes sense. thanks

Bot: Good luck on the date. Ask questions and actually listen to the answers.

User: will do!
