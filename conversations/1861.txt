User: i keep picking fights with my partner

Bot: About what?

User: stupid stuff. the dishes. how they load the dishwasher

Bot: Is it really about the dishes?

User: probably not

Bot: What's actually bothering you?

User: i feel like they dont put in effort

Bot: The dishwasher is a symbol of larger patterns?

User: i guess. im always the one doing things right

Bot: Have you told them directly about the effort imbalance?

User: not really. i just get mad about the dishes

Bot: So they think you're unreasonable about dishes when you're actually upset about contribution.

User: yeah

Bot: They can't fix what they don't know about.

User: how do i bring it up

Bot: "I've been snapping about small things but I think it's because I'm feeling like I carry more of the load."

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: They might. But the conversation needs to happen or the fights will continue.

User: i know

Bot: Pick a calm time. Not during an argument. Frame it as a problem to solve together.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: The dishes aren't the issue. The issue deserves a real conversation.
