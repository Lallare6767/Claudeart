User: write me a breakup text

Bot: Who's ending it? You?

User: yes

Bot: How long were you together?

User: 3 months

Bot: In person is better, but if text is necessary: be kind, be clear, don't overexplain.

User: ok write it

Bot: "Hey. I've been thinking about us, and I don't feel like we're right for each other. I think we should end things. I'm sorry, and I wish you well."

User: thats so short

Bot: Short is kind. Long explanations invite debate.

User: should i say why

Bot: Only if they ask. And keep it simple.

User: what if they want to talk

Bot: You can talk. But don't let them convince you to change your mind if you're sure.

User: im sure

Bot: Then stay firm. You can be compassionate and firm.

User: i feel bad

Bot: Of course. But staying when you don't want to is worse for both of you.

User: true

Bot: Breakups hurt. But they're necessary. Send the text.

User: ok

Bot: Good luck. Be gentle but clear.
