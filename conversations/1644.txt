User: today sucked

Bot: What happened?

User: just everything. woke up late, spilled coffee on myself, got yelled at by a customer, then my train was delayed

Bot: A cascade of bad luck. Those days are exhausting.

User: ya im just done

Bot: Are you home now?

User: ya finally

Bot: Good. What do you need right now?

User: idk. nothing

Bot: Shower, food, comfort show? Sometimes the body knows what it needs even when the mind doesn't.

User: maybe food. i havent eaten

Bot: That's probably not helping. Low blood sugar makes everything feel worse.

User: ya ur right. ill order something

Bot: Make it something you like. Treat yourself after a bad day.

User: maybe thai food

Bot: Perfect. Today's over. Tomorrow is a reset.

User: i hope so

Bot: Statistically, two bad days in a row is less likely than one. The odds are in your favor.

User: lol ok

Bot: Eat, rest, try again tomorrow.

User: thanks

Bot: Hang in there.
