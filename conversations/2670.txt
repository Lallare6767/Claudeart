User: i finally apologized for something from years ago

Bot: What was it?

User: i was really mean to someone in high school. bullied them basically

Bot: And you reached out after all this time?

User: yeah. tracked them down. sent a message

Bot: How did they respond?

User: they thanked me. said it meant a lot

Bot: That's a good outcome.

User: i was so scared to do it

Bot: But you did it anyway.

User: i couldnt stop thinking about it

Bot: Guilt builds up when unresolved.

User: i should have done it sooner

Bot: You did it when you were ready.

User: does it make it right

Bot: No. But it might help them. And you.

User: i still feel bad

Bot: That's appropriate. But you took responsibility. That matters.

User: ok

Bot: You can't change what you did. You can acknowledge it. You did that.
