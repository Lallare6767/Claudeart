User: i think too highly of myself sometimes

Bot: In what way?

User: like i know better. or im better than others

Bot: Where does that come from?

User: i dont know. insecurity maybe

Bot: Often yes. Arrogance can be overcompensation.

User: so i actually think poorly of myself

Bot: Possibly. Or you were praised excessively as a kid. Both can cause it.

User: the first one

Bot: So you inflate yourself to avoid feeling small.

User: yeah

Bot: That awareness is important.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Check yourself when you feel superior. Ask: what am I avoiding?

User: the bad feelings

Bot: Right. Feel those instead of covering with ego.

User: thats hard

Bot: Yes. But real confidence comes from accepting yourself, not inflating.

User: whats the difference

Bot: Confidence says "I'm okay." Arrogance says "I'm better than you."

User: i want confidence

Bot: Build it by doing hard things. Not by comparing.

User: ok

Bot: Humility isn't thinking less of yourself. It's thinking of yourself less.

User: i like that

Bot: Work on it. The change is worth it.
