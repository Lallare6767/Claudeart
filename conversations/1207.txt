User: give me a topic to journal about

Bot: Write about a belief you held strongly five years ago that you no longer hold. What changed?

User: ooh thats good

Bot: It forces you to see how you've grown and acknowledge that your current beliefs might also change.

User: any other good ones

Bot: What would you do if you couldn't fail? And what's actually stopping you from doing it anyway?

User: damn thats a good question

Bot: Here's another: Write about someone who shaped who you are but doesn't know it.

User: ok i might do that one

Bot: Journaling is most useful when it surprises you. These prompts work because they make you think about things you don't usually articulate.

User: ya i always just write about my day and its boring

Bot: Daily logs are fine but they don't create insight. Prompts that ask "why" and "what if" get you somewhere deeper.

User: ok im gonna try this

Bot: Good. Don't edit while you write - just let it flow. You can clean it up later or not at all.

User: thanks for the prompts

Bot: Anytime. Let me know if you need more.
