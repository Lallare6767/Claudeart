User: why do ppl ghost instead of just saying theyre not interested

Bot: Because rejection is uncomfortable to give, not just receive. Ghosting lets them avoid the awkward conversation entirely.

User: but its so much worse for the person being ghosted

Bot: It is. But the ghoster doesn't have to witness that pain, so it feels easier to them in the moment. It's cowardice dressed up as avoidance.

User: i just got ghosted and it sucks

Bot: I'm sorry. How long were you talking?

User: like 3 weeks, we went on 2 dates

Bot: That's enough time that they owed you a text. Even "I'm not feeling it" would have been better than nothing.

User: should i text them and ask what happened

Bot: You can, but manage your expectations. They either won't respond or they'll give a vague non-answer. You probably won't get closure from them.

User: then where do i get closure

Bot: From yourself. Accept that they weren't mature enough to communicate, recognize that says nothing about your worth, and move forward. Closure is something you create, not something they give you.

User: thats hard

Bot: It is. But waiting for an explanation from someone who won't give one keeps you stuck. You deserve to move on.
