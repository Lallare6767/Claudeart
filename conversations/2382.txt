User: what is circumference

Bot: Distance around a circle. C = 2πr or C = πd.

User: whats the difference

Bot: Same thing. Diameter is twice the radius. d = 2r.

User: example

Bot: Circle with radius 5. C = 2π(5) = 10π ≈ 31.4.

User: what if diameter is 8

Bot: C = π(8) = 8π ≈ 25.1.

User: when do i use which formula

Bot: Use what you're given. Radius → 2πr. Diameter → πd.

User: and area?

Bot: A = πr². Different formula.

User: example

Bot: Radius 5. A = π(25) = 25π ≈ 78.5.

User: why is π everywhere

Bot: It's the ratio of circumference to diameter. Universal for circles.

User: all circles?

Bot: All circles. That's what makes it special.

User: what is π exactly

Bot: 3.14159... It's irrational. Goes on forever without repeating.

User: weird

Bot: Beautiful. Circles are mathematically perfect.

User: thanks

Bot: Know 2πr and πr². Those solve most circle problems.
