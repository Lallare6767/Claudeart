User: my friend keeps one-upping everything i say

Bot: What do you mean?

User: if i had a bad day they had a worse one. if i went somewhere cool they went somewhere cooler

Bot: That's exhausting to be around.

User: ya i dread telling them anything

Bot: Have you noticed why they do it?

User: insecurity maybe?

Bot: Probably. They need to feel significant so they redirect attention back to themselves.

User: so what do i do

Bot: A few options. You can name it: "I notice when I share something you always top it. I just want to be heard."

User: they might get defensive

Bot: They might. Or you can just share less with them. Not everyone is a good listener.

User: thats sad though. weve been friends for years

Bot: Friendship longevity doesn't equal friendship quality. You can care about someone who isn't good at this.

User: so accept it or address it

Bot: Pretty much. Accepting it means adjusting expectations. Addressing it might improve things or might not.

User: ill think about which to do

Bot: Either way you've identified the problem. That helps you stop being surprised by it.

User: true. thanks

Bot: Good luck with it.
