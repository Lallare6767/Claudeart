User: what percent of 80 is 24

Bot: 30%.

User: how do u calculate that

Bot: (24/80) × 100 = 0.3 × 100 = 30%.

User: ok what about what percent of 150 is 45

Bot: 30%.

User: same answer interesting. 72 out of 200

Bot: 36%.

User: now the reverse - 40% of what number is 60

Bot: 150. If 40% is 60, then 100% = 60/0.4 = 150.

User: oh so u divide by the percent

Bot: Yes. x × 0.4 = 60, so x = 60/0.4.

User: these are useful for shopping sales lol

Bot: Exactly. "40% off" means you pay 60% of the price.

User: i always do math wrong in stores

Bot: Shortcut: to find 40% off, find 10% and multiply by 4. Much easier.

User: oh thats smart

Bot: Mental math is all about shortcuts.

User: thanks for the practice

Bot: Happy to help. Save some money!
