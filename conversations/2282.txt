Bot: Where have you tried to fit?

User: school. work. social groups. even my family

Bot: What makes you feel like you don't fit?

User: i think differently. want different things

Bot: Different from what specifically?

User: everyone wants stability. i want adventure. everyone wants normal. i want weird

Bot: Then you're looking for belonging in the wrong places.

User: where should i look

Bot: Places that value what you value. They exist.

User: i havent found them

Bot: Have you looked beyond your immediate environment?

User: not really

Bot: That's the problem. You're trying to fit a circle into square holes nearby. Find other circles.

User: how

Bot: Online communities. Different cities. Niche interests. The internet makes finding your people possible.

User: i guess i assumed something was wrong with me

Bot: There isn't. You're just rare in your current environment.

User: thats a nicer way to see it

Bot: It's also accurate. Stop trying to fit. Start finding.

User: ok

Bot: You don't need to fit everywhere. Just somewhere.
