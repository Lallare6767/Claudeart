Bot: Fifth word is "jumps."

User: what letter appears most

Bot: Let me count: t(2), h(1), e(3), q(1), u(2), i(1), c(1), k(1), b(1), r(2), o(4), w(1), n(1), f(1), x(1), j(1), m(1), p(1), s(1), v(1), l(1), a(1), z(1), y(1), d(1), g(1).

"O" appears 4 times - that's the most.

User: wow u actually counted

Bot: That sentence is designed to use every letter of the alphabet, so the distribution is fairly even. "O" wins slightly.

User: thats why its famous

Bot: Exactly. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" - all 26 letters. It's called a pangram.

User: cool. thanks for the word games

Bot: Anytime. Good attention to detail practice.
