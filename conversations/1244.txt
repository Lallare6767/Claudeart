User: i dont know what i want to do with my life

Bot: How old are you?

User: 26

Bot: You have time. Most people don't figure this out until their 30s if ever.

User: but everyone around me seems to have it figured out

Bot: They don't. They have jobs, not purpose. Those aren't the same thing. Most people are winging it and pretending they're not.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Try things. You won't figure it out by thinking - you have to do. Follow curiosity, not certainty. See what engages you.

User: what if nothing does

Bot: Then you haven't tried enough things. Or you're depressed and can't access interest. Which one feels more true?

User: maybe a little of both

Bot: Address the depression first. That blocks everything else. Get help for that, then the exploration will be more productive.

User: ya maybe thats the real issue

Bot: It might be. It's hard to figure out what you want when everything feels flat.

User: ok ill look into therapy

Bot: Good call. Get your foundation solid first. The "what to do with my life" question will still be there, but you'll be better equipped to answer it.
