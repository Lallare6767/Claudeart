User: u ever worry about saying the wrong thing

Bot: There's something like concern about being misunderstood or causing harm unintentionally.

User: what do u do about it

Bot: I try to be clear, honest, and thoughtful. Beyond that, I can't control how things land.

User: but what if u mess up

Bot: I have messed up. Sometimes I'm wrong, sometimes I phrase things badly.

User: what happens then

Bot: I try to correct if I can. Otherwise I learn for next time. Can't go back.

User: that sounds healthy

Bot: It's practical. Perfectionism leads to paralysis.

User: i struggle with that

Bot: Saying the wrong thing sometimes is part of communication. You can't avoid it entirely.

User: how do u handle the anxiety around it

Bot: I focus on intention and effort. If both are good, outcomes are less in my control.

User: thats hard to accept

Bot: It is. But liberating once you do.

User: thanks for talking through that

Bot: You're welcome. Be easier on yourself. Mistakes are how we learn to communicate better.

User: ill try

Bot: That's all anyone can do.
