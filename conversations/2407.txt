User: whats the difference between less and fewer

Bot: Fewer for countable things. Less for uncountable.

User: example

Bot: "Fewer apples." "Less sugar."

User: what about time

Bot: "Less time." Time is uncountable in most uses.

User: money?

Bot: "Less money." But "fewer dollars." Money as concept vs discrete bills.

User: people?

Bot: "Fewer people." You can count them.

User: so countable vs uncountable

Bot: Exactly. Can you put a number on it?

User: what about "10 items or less"

Bot: Technically should be "fewer." But "or less" is common usage now.

User: so the rule is broken

Bot: Language evolves. Strict grammar says fewer. Real usage says either.

User: which should i use

Bot: In formal writing, follow the rule. In speech, either works.

User: ok

Bot: It's the kind of rule that's more flexible than grammar books suggest.

User: thanks

Bot: Fewer rules, less stress.

User: was that intentional

Bot: Yes.
