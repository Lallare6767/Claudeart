User: what are some good questions to ask on a first date

Bot: Anything that reveals values and priorities without feeling like an interview.

User: examples?

Bot: "What do you do when you're not working?" - shows interests and how they spend time.

User: good one

Bot: "What are you excited about right now?" - positive framing, shows what lights them up.

User: ooh i like that

Bot: "Tell me about your friends" - people are revealed by their relationships.

User: what should i avoid asking

Bot: Salary, exes in detail, why they're single, anything you wouldn't answer yourself.

User: makes sense

Bot: Also avoid rapid-fire questions. Let conversations develop naturally.

User: what if theres awkward silence

Bot: That's fine. Better than forcing it. Sometimes silence means they're thinking.

User: im nervous lol

Bot: That's normal. They probably are too. Just be curious about them as a person.

User: thanks for the help

Bot: Good luck! Try to have fun with it.
