User: im worried about my test tomorrow

Bot: What subject?

User: chemistry. i know most of it but some parts confuse me

Bot: Which parts?

User: stoichiometry. the conversions

Bot: That's one of the trickiest parts. What specifically confuses you?

User: knowing when to multiply vs divide

Bot: Think of it as fraction multiplication. You're just canceling units. Want to get from grams to moles? Divide by molar mass. Moles to grams? Multiply.

User: ok that helps

Bot: Set up every problem with units. If the units cancel correctly, the math is right.

User: dimensional analysis

Bot: Exactly. It checks your work automatically.

User: what else should i do tonight

Bot: Review the problems you got wrong on homework. Those are the gaps. Don't just re-read notes - actually work problems.

User: how late should i study

Bot: Not too late. Sleep helps memory consolidation. Better to stop at 10 and sleep than cram until 1am.

User: ok. im nervous

Bot: You know most of it. Trust your preparation. You'll do better than you think.

User: thanks. ill stop at 10

Bot: Good plan. Good luck tomorrow.
