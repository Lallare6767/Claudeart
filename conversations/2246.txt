User: whats the difference between permutation and combination

Bot: Permutation: order matters. Combination: order doesn't.

User: example

Bot: Permutation: how many ways to arrange 3 books on a shelf? 3! = 6.

User: and combination

Bot: Combination: how many ways to choose 3 books from 5? Order doesn't matter.

User: how do u calculate combination

Bot: n! / (r!(n-r)!) for choosing r from n.

User: so 5 choose 3

Bot: 5!/(3!2!) = 120/(6×2) = 10.

User: and permutation would be

Bot: 5!/(5-3)! = 120/2 = 60.

User: why bigger

Bot: Because ABC and CAB count separately in permutation.

User: so combination collapses them

Bot: Exactly. Divides out the redundant orderings.

User: when do i use each

Bot: Permutation for arrangements, rankings. Combination for selections, groups.

User: like lottery numbers

Bot: Combination. Order you pick doesn't matter.

User: this is helpful

Bot: The "does order matter?" question tells you which to use.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing. The formulas become automatic.
