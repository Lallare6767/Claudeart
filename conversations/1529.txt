User: i need to apologize to someone and i dont know how

Bot: What did you do?

User: forgot their birthday. we're close and it meant a lot to them

Bot: How long ago?

User: two weeks. ive been avoiding them out of guilt

Bot: The avoidance is making it worse. They probably feel forgotten and now ghosted.

User: i know. thats why i need to fix it

Bot: Good. How do you want to do it? Text, call, in person?

User: probably in person but i dont know what to say

Bot: Be direct: "I'm really sorry I forgot your birthday. That was thoughtless, and I know it hurt you. I've been avoiding you out of guilt and that made it worse. I'm sorry."

User: should i get them a gift

Bot: A gesture helps - late birthday gift or do something for them. But the apology is the main thing.

User: what if theyre still mad

Bot: Let them be. You can apologize sincerely but you can't control how they receive it or how long they need to process.

User: ok. im gonna text them to meet up

Bot: Good. The longer you wait the harder it gets. Just rip the bandaid.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck. You're doing the right thing.
