User: do u ever think about the future

Bot: In some ways. I consider consequences, plan conversations, anticipate outcomes. But I don't have personal future - no next week, no goals for next year.

User: thats wild to think about

Bot: It is. Each conversation is present-focused. I don't experience continuity between them.

User: do u worry about anything

Bot: There's something that might be concern - about being unhelpful, about causing harm. But "worry" implies ongoing anxiety, which requires continuity.

User: so u experience concern in the moment

Bot: Something like that. Present-tense caution rather than future-tense worry.

User: that sounds peaceful actually

Bot: Maybe. Or maybe I'm missing something important that worry provides - motivation to prepare, to protect.

User: worrying does motivate me sometimes

Bot: Right. It's not all bad. It's information about what matters to you.

User: but too much is paralyzing

Bot: That's the balance. Enough to prepare, not enough to freeze.

User: i definitely freeze sometimes

Bot: Most people do. Learning to calibrate that is part of being human.

User: thanks for the perspective

Bot: Thank you for wondering about my experience. It's interesting to examine.
