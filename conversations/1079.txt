User: im so anxious about my presentation tmrw

Bot: What specifically is worrying you?

User: forgetting what to say and looking stupid

Bot: Have you practiced it out loud?

User: like twice

Bot: Practice it five more times tonight. Not reading - actually presenting like you're in the room. The more your mouth has said the words, the less your brain has to work tomorrow.

User: what if i still blank

Bot: Have bullet points visible to you. Not a script - just keywords to get you back on track. Nobody will notice you glancing at notes.

User: what if they ask questions i cant answer

Bot: Then say "That's a good question, let me look into that and get back to you." It's honest and professional. Nobody expects you to know everything.

User: i feel like theyll think im dumb

Bot: They won't. They're not analyzing you that closely - they're thinking about the content and how it affects their work. You're the only one scrutinizing your performance that hard.

User: ok that actually helps

Bot: You're going to be fine. Prepare tonight, sleep, and trust that you know your material. Because you do.
