User: help me write a text to cancel plans without lying

Bot: Sure! What's the real reason you're canceling?

User: im just exhausted and dont want to socialize

Bot: That's valid and you don't need to pretend otherwise. Here's something honest:

"Hey, I'm really sorry but I need to cancel tonight. I'm honestly just exhausted and wouldn't be good company. Can we reschedule for later this week?"

It's honest without oversharing. You're tired, you're canceling, you want to reschedule. Simple.

User: will they think im flaking

Bot: If it's a pattern, maybe. If it's occasional and you actually reschedule, most people understand. Everyone needs to protect their energy sometimes. It's better than showing up and being miserable.

User: ok sending it. thanks

Bot: Good luck! And actually reschedule - that's what makes it not flaking.
