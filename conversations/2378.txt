User: i keep apologizing for everything

Bot: Give me an example.

User: "sorry i took so long" "sorry i dont understand" "sorry for asking"

Bot: You're apologizing for existing.

User: i guess

Bot: Where did you learn that your needs are inconvenient?

User: i dont know. always been this way

Bot: It's learned behavior. Probably to keep peace or avoid conflict.

User: yeah

Bot: Apologies are for harm. Taking a normal amount of time isn't harm.

User: i know but its automatic

Bot: Try replacing sorry with thank you.

User: how

Bot: "Thanks for waiting" instead of "sorry I'm late." "Thanks for explaining" instead of "sorry I didn't understand."

User: that feels weird

Bot: At first. But it shifts from deference to appreciation.

User: i like that

Bot: It also stops putting yourself down constantly.

User: i do that a lot

Bot: You do. Save apologies for when you actually do something wrong.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Your presence isn't an imposition. Stop apologizing for it.
