User: i want to give up

Bot: On what?

User: everything. its too hard

Bot: What happened?

User: everything i try fails. relationships. jobs. projects

Bot: How do you define failure?

User: not working out

Bot: "Not working out" and "failing" aren't the same.

User: feels the same

Bot: One is outcome. One is judgment. Outcomes can teach. Judgment just hurts.

User: so reframe it?

Bot: Yes. What did you learn from these things not working out?

User: that im bad at picking things

Bot: Or that you're trying things. Which most people don't.

User: thats a stretch

Bot: Is it? Most people don't leave bad relationships. Don't change jobs. Don't start projects.

User: i guess

Bot: You're not failing. You're iterating. That takes courage.

User: doesnt feel courageous

Bot: Because it hurts. But hurt and courage coexist.

User: ok

Bot: Don't give up. Rest if you need to. But don't quit.

User: ok

Bot: You're closer than you think. Patterns show themselves before breakthroughs.
