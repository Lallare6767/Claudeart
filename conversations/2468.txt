User: i cant let go of things

Bot: What kinds of things?

User: grudges. past mistakes. old hurts

Bot: What does holding onto them give you?

User: i dont know. nothing good

Bot: Usually it's protection or justice seeking.

User: maybe both

Bot: Protection: if I don't forgive, they can't hurt me again. Justice: they should pay.

User: yeah

Bot: Does holding on achieve those?

User: no. they've moved on. im the one suffering

Bot: So you're punishing yourself with their mistakes.

User: when u put it that way

Bot: Letting go isn't saying it was okay. It's freeing yourself from carrying it.

User: how do i do that

Bot: Feel it fully. Then choose to put it down. Repeat as needed.

User: repeat?

Bot: You'll pick it back up. Letting go is practice, not an event.

User: ok

Bot: Therapy helps a lot with this specifically.

User: ok

Bot: You deserve to move forward. Give yourself permission.

User: ok thanks

Bot: The past can't be changed. Only your relationship to it can.
