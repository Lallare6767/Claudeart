User: what is a prime number

Bot: A number divisible only by 1 and itself.

User: so 7 is prime

Bot: Yes. Only 1 and 7 divide it evenly.

User: and 9

Bot: Not prime. 3 × 3 = 9.

User: whats the first prime

Bot: 2. Also the only even prime.

User: why only even one

Bot: All other even numbers are divisible by 2.

User: is 1 prime

Bot: No. By definition, primes must have exactly two distinct factors.

User: what are the first several primes

Bot: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.

User: why do they matter

Bot: Building blocks of all numbers. Every number factors into primes uniquely.

User: like 12

Bot: 12 = 2² × 3.

User: and 100

Bot: 100 = 2² × 5².

User: cool

Bot: Primes are also used in cryptography. They secure your data.

User: really?

Bot: Yes. Factoring large primes is what keeps encryption safe.

User: thanks!

Bot: Primes are simple but endlessly interesting.
