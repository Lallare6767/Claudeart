User: i think i have adhd but never been diagnosed

Bot: What makes you think that?

User: cant focus, always losing stuff, starting projects and never finishing, feeling restless

Bot: Those are common ADHD symptoms. How long have you experienced them?

User: forever. but i thought everyone was like this

Bot: That's common too - people think their experience is universal until they realize it's not.

User: should i get tested

Bot: If it's affecting your life significantly, yes. A diagnosis can open access to treatment and accommodations.

User: im worried they'll say its not adhd

Bot: Then you've ruled something out and can look for other explanations. Either way you'll know more.

User: what if they say i just need to try harder

Bot: Find a different provider. "Try harder" isn't treatment - it's dismissal.

User: where do i even go

Bot: Start with your primary care doctor for a referral, or look for a psychiatrist or psychologist who specializes in ADHD in adults.

User: ok maybe ill make an appointment

Bot: Knowledge helps. Even if it's not ADHD, understanding why you function the way you do is valuable.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. You deserve to understand your brain.
