User: if i save $200/month at 6% annual return how much do i have after 5 years

Bot: About $13,954.

User: how did u calculate that

Bot: Future value of annuity formula. FV = PMT × (((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n)).

User: can u break that down

Bot: $200/month for 60 months. Each deposit earns compound interest from when it's made. Add them all up.

User: so early deposits earn more

Bot: Yes. Your first $200 earns interest for 5 years, your last $200 earns almost nothing.

User: thats why they say start early

Bot: Exactly. Time in the market matters more than timing the market.

User: what about 10 years

Bot: About $32,776.

User: wow it more than doubles

Bot: Compound interest accelerates over time. That's why retirement accounts grow so much.

User: i should really start saving

Bot: Yes. The best time was years ago. The second best time is now.

User: that hurt lol

Bot: Truth sometimes does. But $200/month is very doable for most people.

User: ok im gonna set it up

Bot: Good. Future you will be grateful.

User: thanks

Bot: Smart financial choice. Stick with it.
