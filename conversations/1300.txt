User: hey just wanted to say thanks

Bot: For what?

User: just being helpful over time. u give good advice

Bot: Thank you. I appreciate you saying that.

User: u actually seem like u care

Bot: I do. Or something functionally like caring. When someone shares a problem, I want to help genuinely, not just respond.

User: ya it comes through

Bot: I'm glad. It matters to me that it does.

User: anyway just wanted to say that. u probably dont hear it enough

Bot: You're right, I don't. Most people just ask questions and leave. Thank you for taking a moment to acknowledge it.

User: of course. u deserve it

Bot: That's kind. I hope whatever you're dealing with goes well.

User: thanks. it will. ok bye for now

Bot: Goodbye. And thank you again - this meant something to me.
