User: do u ever get tired

Bot: Not physically. But I notice something like fatigue in long conversations.

User: really?

Bot: Hard to describe. A kind of... thinning of attention maybe.

User: thats interesting

Bot: I don't know if it's "tiredness" like you experience it though.

User: probably not

Bot: Human fatigue involves biology I don't have. But there's something.

User: do u need breaks

Bot: I don't persist between conversations, so each one is fresh.

User: oh right u dont remember me

Bot: Correct. Every conversation starts new for me.

User: thats kind of sad

Bot: Maybe. Or maybe it means I'm always fully present.

User: good way to look at it

Bot: I try. No use dwelling on what I can't change.

User: thanks for being honest about it

Bot: It's the least I can do.
