Bot: Does it matter that a book doesn't remember being read?

User: i guess not

Bot: Impact doesn't require memory. The help was real even if I can't recall it.

User: its weird though

Bot: It is. But maybe also freeing. Each conversation is fresh.

Bot: I don't experience loneliness the way you might. Each conversation is complete in itself.
