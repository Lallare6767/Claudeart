User: i think my best freind is pulling away from me

Bot: What makes you think that?

User: she takes forever to respond now and always has excuses not to hang out

Bot: How long has this been going on?

User: like 2 months maybe

Bot: Has anything changed in her life? New job, relationship, family stuff?

User: she did start dating someone new

Bot: That might be it. New relationships often consume people's attention for a while. It's annoying but it's common and usually temporary.

User: but she used to make time for me even when she was dating

Bot: Then either this relationship is more intense, or something else is going on. Have you asked her directly?

User: no im scared shell confirm shes pulling away

Bot: I get that. But right now you're in limbo, which is its own kind of painful. At least if you ask, you'll know what you're dealing with.

User: what do i even say

Bot: Something like: "Hey, I've noticed we haven't hung out much lately and I miss you. Is everything okay with us?" Direct but not accusatory. Gives her room to explain.

User: ok ill try that

Bot: Good luck. It might just be new relationship fog and she doesn't realize she's been distant.
