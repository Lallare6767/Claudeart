User: what should i wear to a job interview

Bot: What's the industry and what level position?

User: tech startup, junior role

Bot: Business casual probably. Button-down shirt or nice blouse, dark jeans or chinos, clean shoes. Not a suit unless they specifically mentioned formal.

User: i was gonna wear a hoodie

Bot: Don't. Casual startup doesn't mean interviewing in a hoodie. You can dress down after you get the job, but for the interview, look like you care.

User: ok what about sneakers

Bot: Clean, minimal sneakers can work if your outfit is put together. Beat-up running shoes, no.

User: so basically look presentable

Bot: Exactly. One notch above what you'd wear on a normal day there. Shows effort without overdressing.

User: what if im overdressed

Bot: Better than underdressed. Nobody ever lost a job for wearing a nice shirt.

User: ok button down and dark jeans

Bot: Good choice. Make sure everything is clean and fits well. Wrinkles and stains are the enemy.

User: thanks. interview is tomorrow

Bot: Good luck. You've got this.
