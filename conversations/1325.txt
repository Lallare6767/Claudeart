User: i feel like im losing my best friend

Bot: What's happening?

User: we just dont talk as much anymore. shes busy, im busy

Bot: Is it mutual drifting or is one of you pulling away?

User: i think its mutual but i miss her

Bot: Have you told her that?

User: no i dont want to be needy

Bot: Telling your best friend you miss her isn't needy - it's honest. She might feel the same way and be waiting for you to say something.

User: i guess i could reach out

Bot: Yes. "I miss you, can we make time to hang out?" is straightforward and not dramatic.

User: what if shes just done with the friendship

Bot: Then at least you'll know. But the more likely scenario is she's also been thinking about it and will be glad you said something.

User: we used to be so close

Bot: Friendships require maintenance. Life gets busy and you have to be intentional about preserving what matters.

User: ya i need to be more intentional

Bot: Reach out. The worst case is she's moved on. The better case is you reconnect and laugh about how you both let it slide.

User: ok ill text her today

Bot: Good luck. Friendships are worth fighting for.
