User: i keep getting defensive when people give me feedback

Bot: What does that look like?

User: arguing. explaining. making excuses

Bot: What's the underlying feeling?

User: like im being attacked i guess

Bot: Even when they're trying to help?

User: yeah even then

Bot: Defensiveness is usually protecting something. What are you protecting?

User: my ego i guess. the idea that im good at things

Bot: So feedback threatens your self-image.

User: when u put it like that yeah

Bot: The irony is defensiveness prevents improvement, which makes you actually worse.

User: i know. i hate it

Bot: Next time you get feedback, try saying "thank you" before anything else.

User: thats it?

Bot: Just those two words. It buys you time and reframes it as a gift not an attack.

User: then what

Bot: Then actually consider if they might be right before responding further.

User: ok ill try thank you first

Bot: It's a small hack but it works. Breaks the automatic defense response.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. This is hard to change but worth it.
