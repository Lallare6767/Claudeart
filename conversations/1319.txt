User: whats the derivative of e^x

Bot: e^x. It's one of the special properties of e - the derivative of e^x is itself.

User: what about e^(2x)

Bot: 2e^(2x). Chain rule: derivative of the exponent times the original.

User: and ln(x)

Bot: 1/x.

User: why

Bot: Because ln is the inverse of e^x. The derivative of ln(x) gives you the rate at which you need to grow to reach x, which is 1/x.

User: ok what about ln(2x)

Bot: 2/(2x) = 1/x. Or you can think of it as ln(2) + ln(x), and the ln(2) derivative is 0.

User: wait both ways give the same answer

Bot: They have to - they're the same function. Just different ways to compute it.

User: ok this is making more sense

Bot: Exponential and log derivatives are mostly memorization plus chain rule. Once you know the base cases, you can derive the rest.

User: thanks for the calculus help

Bot: Anytime. Calculus is patterns - once you see them, it's mostly mechanical.
