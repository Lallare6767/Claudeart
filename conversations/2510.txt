Bot: Normal. New environment is scary. Give her time.

User: how long

Bot: Few days to a week usually. Leave food and water nearby.

User: should i try to coax her out

Bot: No. Let her come out when ready. Pressure makes it worse.

User: ok

Bot: Talk to her softly so she learns your voice.

User: without looking at her?

Bot: Direct eye contact can be threatening. Slow blinks are good.
