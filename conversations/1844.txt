User: my therapist wants me to try medication

Bot: How do you feel about that?

User: scared. i dont want to change my personality

Bot: That's a common fear. What did your therapist say about that concern?

User: that its not how it works but i dont really believe it

Bot: Have you talked to anyone who's been on medication?

User: no

Bot: It might help. People often describe it as feeling more like themselves, not less.

User: what if it doesnt work

Bot: Then you try a different one or stop. It's not permanent or irreversible.

User: what if there are side effects

Bot: There might be. Your doctor monitors for them. Most are temporary.

User: i dont like the idea of needing a pill to be okay

Bot: Do you feel that way about insulin for diabetics? Or glasses for vision?

User: no but thats different

Bot: Is it though? Brain chemistry is as physical as anything else.

User: i guess

Bot: You don't have to try it. But don't reject it out of stigma.

User: ok ill think about it more

Bot: Ask your therapist all your concerns. They've heard them before.

User: thanks

Bot: Whatever you decide, make sure it's informed.
