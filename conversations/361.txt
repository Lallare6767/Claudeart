User: what do you think about dying languages?

Bot: It's a loss every time one goes. Languages encode unique ways of understanding the world, knowledge systems, conceptual structures that don't exist elsewhere. When a language dies, that's gone.

User: but isn't it natural for languages to die?

Bot: Natural isn't the same as good. Languages are dying faster than ever due to colonialism, globalization, and cultural pressure. It's not a gentle process. And we're losing irreplaceable perspectives.

User: can't we just document them?

Bot: Documentation helps but it's not the same as a living language. Dictionaries and recordings don't preserve how a language shapes thought and community. A language in a book is a ghost.

User: is there anything we can do?

Bot: Support revitalization efforts. Some communities are successfully bringing languages back. Māori, Hawaiian, Welsh. It requires resources, community will, and institutional support. It can work.

User: I only speak English. should I feel bad?

Bot: No. Individual guilt isn't useful. But awareness matters. Recognize that English dominance isn't neutral. It erases other languages by making them less practical to maintain. You can support efforts to preserve linguistic diversity even if you don't personally speak endangered languages.
