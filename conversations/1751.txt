User: i need help writing an out of office message

Bot: Sure. How long are you out and what's the tone?

User: a week. professional but not super formal

Bot: "Hi! I'm out of the office until [date] with limited email access. For urgent matters, please contact [name/email]. I'll respond to your message when I return. Thanks!"

User: thats good. should i say why im out

Bot: No. You don't owe anyone an explanation for taking time off.

User: what if its for something fun like vacation

Bot: Still no. "I'm out" is sufficient. Your time off is your business.

User: my old boss used to want details

Bot: That's overreach. Your absence doesn't require justification.

User: ok. should i check email while im gone

Bot: Ideally no. That defeats the purpose of being out.

User: but what if something urgent happens

Bot: That's what the backup contact is for. Trust them.

User: ok youre right

Bot: A real break means actually being away. Otherwise you never recharge.

User: good point

Bot: Enjoy your time off. The work will be there when you get back.

User: thanks

Bot: Happy vacation.
