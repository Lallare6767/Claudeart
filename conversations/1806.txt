User: why am i always tired

Bot: That's a big question. How's your sleep?

User: 7-8 hours usually

Bot: Quality matters more than quantity. Do you wake up rested?

User: not really

Bot: Sleep apnea, stress, alcohol, screen time before bed - any of those?

User: screens definitely. maybe stress

Bot: Both wreck sleep quality. You're getting hours but not deep sleep.

User: what else could it be

Bot: Diet - are you eating enough? Drinking water? Iron levels?

User: i dont eat great

Bot: Low energy often comes from poor fuel.

User: should i see a doctor

Bot: If it persists, yes. They can check thyroid, vitamin levels, sleep disorders.

User: what can i do right now

Bot: No screens an hour before bed. More water. Eat breakfast with protein.

User: thats a lot of changes

Bot: Pick one. Start there. Small changes compound.

User: ok no screens at night

Bot: Good choice. That alone can make a difference.

User: thanks

Bot: Take care of the basics. Energy usually follows.
