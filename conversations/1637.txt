User: i keep saying ill start tomorrow

Bot: Starting what?

User: everything. exercise, eating better, working on my project

Bot: And then tomorrow becomes today and you say it again?

User: exactly. its a cycle

Bot: "Tomorrow" is a comfortable distance. It's commitment without action.

User: so how do i break it

Bot: Don't start tomorrow. Start now. Not all of it - one tiny thing.

User: like what

Bot: If it's exercise - put on workout clothes. That's it. If eating better - throw out one junk food item. If project - open the document.

User: that seems too small

Bot: It is small. That's why you'll actually do it. Momentum builds from motion, not planning.

User: ok what if i do the tiny thing and still dont do more

Bot: Then you did something instead of nothing. And tomorrow you do another tiny thing.

User: so its about consistency not size

Bot: Exactly. Doing 1% every day beats doing 0% while planning 100%.

User: ok. im gonna go put on gym clothes

Bot: Right now?

User: ya

Bot: Perfect. That's how it starts.
