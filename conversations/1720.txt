Bot: Anxiety fills empty space. An unoccupied mind becomes a worry generator.

User: how do i stop it

Bot: You can't stop it completely, but you can manage it. Stay present - anxiety is always about the future.

User: how do i stay present

Bot: Focus on what's in front of you. Your breath, what you can see, what needs doing now.

User: that sounds too simple

Bot: Simple isn't the same as easy. Bringing your attention back takes practice.

User: should i try meditation

Bot: It helps many people with exactly this. Trains the muscle of returning to now.
