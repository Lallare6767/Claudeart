User: why am i so tired all the time

Bot: That could be many things. How much are you sleeping?

User: 7-8 hours. should be enough

Bot: It should. How's the quality? Waking up at night?

User: sometimes. my partner snores

Bot: That fragments your sleep even if you don't fully wake. Have you tried earplugs or white noise?

User: not really

Bot: Try it. Sleep interruptions prevent deep sleep even if total hours are fine.

User: what else could it be

Bot: Diet, hydration, exercise, stress, iron or vitamin D deficiency, thyroid issues. When did you last have bloodwork?

User: a while ago

Bot: Worth getting checked. Iron and vitamin D deficiency are common and cause fatigue.

User: ill make an appointment

Bot: Also track caffeine - too much can backfire. And are you actually resting on weekends or still running around?

User: probably not resting enough

Bot: There's your maybe. Bodies need actual downtime, not just sleep.

User: ok. appointment plus more rest

Bot: Good plan. Hope you find the cause.
