User: i feel like i dont have a purpose

Bot: What would purpose look like to you?

User: i dont know. something that matters

Bot: Matters to who? The world? Yourself?

User: maybe both

Bot: That's a big ask. Most people don't have that.

User: so what do they have

Bot: Smaller purposes. Family. Work. Hobbies. Community.

User: that doesnt feel like enough

Bot: Why not?

User: i want to make a difference

Bot: Difference comes in sizes. Small ones count too.

User: i feel like im just existing

Bot: Many people feel that way. It's not just you.

User: that doesnt help

Bot: Maybe not. But purpose is often found, not assigned.

User: how do i find it

Bot: Try things. Notice what makes you feel useful or engaged.

User: ok

Bot: Purpose sometimes shows up while you're doing something else. Keep moving.
