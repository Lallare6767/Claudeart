User: whats the difference between active and passive voice

Bot: Active: subject does action. Passive: subject receives it.

User: examples

Bot: Active: "The dog bit the man." Passive: "The man was bitten by the dog."

User: which is better

Bot: Usually active. It's clearer and stronger.

User: when is passive okay

Bot: When the doer is unknown, unimportant, or you want to de-emphasize them.

User: like what

Bot: "Mistakes were made." Passive hides who made them.

User: thats why politicians use it

Bot: Exactly. Passive can dodge responsibility.

User: how do i identify passive

Bot: Look for "was/were + past participle" and "by [agent]."

User: "the cake was eaten by the kids"

Bot: Passive. Active: "The kids ate the cake."

User: clearer

Bot: Almost always. Passive adds distance.

User: in scientific writing its common though

Bot: Traditionally yes. "The solution was heated." But this is changing.

User: to active?

Bot: Yes. "We heated the solution." Clearer and more direct.

User: thanks

Bot: Default to active. Use passive intentionally for specific effects.
