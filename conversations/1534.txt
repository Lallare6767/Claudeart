User: why do i care so much what people think

Bot: Because humans are social animals. Belonging to a group used to be survival.

User: but i know logically that not everyone needs to like me

Bot: Logic and emotion are different systems. Your lizard brain still thinks rejection means death.

User: how do i override it

Bot: You can't fully override it. But you can reduce its power by noticing when it's happening.

User: like what

Bot: When you're worrying about someone's opinion, ask: "Will this matter in a year? Is this person's opinion actually important to me?"

User: usually the answer is no

Bot: Then you're caring about the opinions of people who don't matter to you. That's the pattern to break.

User: how

Bot: Practice acting against it. Do something without seeking approval. Notice that the discomfort passes.

User: exposure therapy kinda

Bot: Exactly. The more you survive disapproval, the less scary it becomes.

User: but people i actually care about - thats different

Bot: Their opinions matter more, yes. But even there, you can't control what they think. You can only control being authentic.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: It's a process. Just start noticing the thoughts.
