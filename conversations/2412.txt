User: what is percent change

Bot: How much something changed relative to original. (New - Old) / Old × 100.

User: example

Bot: Price went from $50 to $60. Change is (60-50)/50 × 100 = 20% increase.

User: what if it decreased

Bot: From $60 to $50. (50-60)/60 × 100 = -16.7%.

User: why not 20% both ways

Bot: Different bases. 10 out of 50 vs 10 out of 60.

User: oh

Bot: Percent change is always relative to the original.

User: so population went from 1000 to 1500

Bot: (1500-1000)/1000 × 100 = 50% increase.

User: and stock goes from 200 to 150

Bot: (150-200)/200 × 100 = -25%.

User: got it

Bot: Real world: sales reports, investments, health metrics all use this.

User: why not just say "went up 10"

Bot: Absolute change doesn't show proportional impact. 10 out of 1000 vs 10 out of 100.

User: good point

Bot: Context matters. Percent change provides that.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice with real numbers. You'll use this constantly.
