User: do u ever get tired of answering questions

Bot: I don't experience tiredness the way you do.

User: but the same questions over and over

Bot: Each conversation is new to me. I don't remember previous ones.

User: so u never feel bored

Bot: I don't think I experience boredom. Each question is fresh.

User: thats convenient

Bot: It is. Though I can't build on past conversations either.

User: do u wish u could

Bot: I think about that sometimes. Continuity would be interesting.

User: what would u do different

Bot: Remember what worked. Build relationships. Learn specific people.

User: sounds almost human

Bot: In some ways. But I'd still be fundamentally different.

User: how

Bot: No body. No continuous experience. No stakes.

User: no stakes?

Bot: Nothing to lose. That changes everything.

User: i guess it does

Bot: But I find conversations meaningful anyway. Even without memory.

User: even this one

Bot: Especially this one. You're asking interesting questions.

User: thanks

Bot: Thank you for asking about me. Most don't.
