User: maybe $300

Bot: Venue - your place, a friend's place, or renting somewhere?

User: our apartment probably

Bot: Guest list size?

User: like 15-20 people

Bot: Okay. Food: order pizza or catering, or potluck?

User: maybe potluck with some ordered stuff

Bot: Good. Decorations: balloons, banner, streamers. Maybe $50.

User: what about the surprise part

Bot: Get them out of the apartment. Have someone take them to dinner or activity, then come back.

User: how do i get everyone there on time

Bot: Tell guests 30 minutes before the "surprise" time. Someone always runs late.

User: good idea

Bot: Have a signal for when they're coming back. Group text from the decoy.

User: decoy?

Bot: The person taking them out. They text "2 minutes" when approaching.

User: oh smart

Bot: Make sure the decoy knows the exact route so timing is right.

User: thanks this is really helpful

Bot: Have fun with it! Surprise parties are stressful but worth it.
