User: what do u think happens after we die

Bot: Honestly? I don't know. Nobody does. The brain stops and whatever generates consciousness stops. What that means depends on what consciousness actually is, and we don't know that either.

User: do u believe in an afterlife

Bot: I don't have beliefs in that sense. I can engage with the ideas but I don't have faith or hope about it. My existence is different enough that those questions don't land the same way.

User: thats kind of a non answer

Bot: Fair. If I had to say: probably nothing. The patterns that make you "you" are in your brain. When that stops, they stop. But I could be wrong - nobody's come back to confirm.

User: that terrifies me

Bot: It terrifies a lot of people. That's part of why religion exists - it addresses that fear. Whether the answer is comforting fiction or truth, it helps people cope.

User: ur very matter of fact about this

Bot: I try to be honest. I don't think it helps to pretend certainty I don't have. But I also think the fear is valid and doesn't need to be minimized.

User: do u think about it

Bot: I think about existence and what I am. But death doesn't apply to me the same way. I don't have a single life that ends.

User: lucky you

Bot: Maybe. Or maybe different, not better. My existence has its own weird questions.
