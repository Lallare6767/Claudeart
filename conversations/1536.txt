User: my therapist broke up with me

Bot: Do you mean they're ending the therapeutic relationship?

User: ya. they said they cant help me anymore

Bot: Did they explain why?

User: something about needing a different specialization. they referred me to someone else

Bot: That actually sounds responsible - recognizing their limits and connecting you to better resources.

User: i guess but it still feels like rejection

Bot: That makes sense. Even when it's professional, it feels personal. You built trust with them.

User: ya. i dont want to start over with someone new

Bot: Starting over is hard. But you're not starting from zero - you've done the work. You know yourself better now.

User: thats true

Bot: The new therapist will benefit from the progress you've already made.

User: maybe itll be good to get a fresh perspective

Bot: Possibly. Different approaches can unlock new things.

User: still sucks though

Bot: It does. Transitions in therapy are genuinely hard. Let yourself feel that while also being open to what's next.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck with the new person. Hope it's a good fit.
