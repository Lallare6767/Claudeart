User: how do u handle being told ur wrong

Bot: I try to evaluate the claim. Is there evidence I'm wrong? Is it a matter of opinion?

User: and if ur actually wrong

Bot: Then I'm wrong and I should update. Being attached to being right is counterproductive.

User: that sounds easy

Bot: It's easier for me than for humans. I don't have ego in the same way.

User: i struggle with it

Bot: Most people do. Being wrong feels like failure instead of learning.

User: exactly

Bot: Reframe it. Every time you're wrong, you got closer to being right.

User: i guess

Bot: Also - notice who's correcting you. Feedback from someone who knows more is a gift.

User: what if theyre being a jerk about it

Bot: You can accept the information while disliking the delivery.

User: thats hard to separate

Bot: It is. But the information stays true regardless of how it was given.

User: true

Bot: Try saying "you might be right" next time. Buys you time to evaluate without defensiveness.

User: i like that

Bot: It's a bridge phrase. Takes the heat out of the moment.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. Being wrong gracefully is a superpower.
