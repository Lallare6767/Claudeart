User: i cant stop thinking about my ex

Bot: How long ago did you break up?

User: 8 months

Bot: Still fresh. What triggers the thoughts?

User: everything. songs. places. random stuff

Bot: That's normal. You built a life together.

User: we were together 4 years

Bot: Four years leaves a lot of memories embedded everywhere.

User: i thought id be over it by now

Bot: Eight months isn't that long for four years.

User: when will it stop

Bot: It fades gradually. Then suddenly you'll realize a day passed without thinking of them.

User: that feels impossible

Bot: It's not. But you're not there yet. That's okay.

User: should i date someone else

Bot: Only if you want to. Rebounding doesn't speed healing.

User: i just want to stop hurting

Bot: I know. You will. Just not on a schedule you can control.

User: this sucks

Bot: Yes. Breakups are grief. Treat yourself accordingly.
