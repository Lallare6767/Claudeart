User: im jealous of my friends success and i feel bad about it

Bot: What kind of success?

User: she got her dream job and im still stuck in mine

Bot: Jealousy is information. It tells you what you want. The bad feeling isn't about her - it's about your own stagnation.

User: so its not wrong to feel jealous?

Bot: The feeling isn't wrong. It's natural. What matters is what you do with it. Use it as fuel to pursue what you want, not as resentment toward her.

User: i dont resent her i just feel inadequate

Bot: That's comparison, not jealousy. Her getting her dream job doesn't mean you can't get yours. These aren't finite resources.

User: it feels like i should be further along by now

Bot: According to what timeline? Her success has nothing to do with your pace. You're comparing your middle to her milestone.

User: i guess thats true

Bot: Be happy for her and let it motivate you. Then actually work on your own situation. The jealousy will fade when you're making progress.

User: ok. thanks for not judging me

Bot: Everyone feels this way sometimes. The question is whether you let it consume you or move you.
