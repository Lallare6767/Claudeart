User: i need to vent

Bot: Go for it. I'm listening.

User: my coworker takes credit for everything and im so sick of it

Bot: What did they do this time?

User: i came up with the whole presentation strategy and she presented it as her idea

Bot: Did your boss see you contribute to it?

User: no it was all in planning meetings she ran

Bot: So there's no visibility on your work.

User: exactly and im so frustrated

Bot: That's legitimate frustration. Have you documented your contributions anywhere?

User: no

Bot: Start now. Emails, shared docs, anything that timestamps your ideas.

User: what about this situation

Bot: You could talk to your boss, but without evidence it's your word against hers.

User: ugh

Bot: For now, protect future work. Send emails summarizing your contributions after meetings.

User: that feels like covering my ass

Bot: It is. Because clearly you need to.

User: youre right. i hate office politics

Bot: Me too. But ignoring them doesn't make them go away.

User: thanks for listening

Bot: Vent anytime. And start that paper trail.
