User: whats slope intercept form

Bot: y = mx + b. m is slope. b is y-intercept.

User: whats slope again

Bot: Rise over run. How much y changes when x changes.

User: and y-intercept

Bot: Where the line crosses y-axis. The y value when x = 0.

User: can u do an example

Bot: y = 2x + 3. Slope is 2 (up 2 for every 1 right). Y-intercept is 3.

User: so it starts at (0, 3)

Bot: Yes. And goes up 2, over 1, repeatedly.

User: what about y = -x + 5

Bot: Slope is -1 (down 1 for every 1 right). Y-intercept is 5.

User: how do i graph it

Bot: Plot y-intercept. Use slope to find another point. Draw line.

User: what if its not in slope intercept form

Bot: Convert it. 2x + 3y = 6 → 3y = -2x + 6 → y = -2/3x + 2.

User: isolate y

Bot: Exactly. Get y alone and it's in mx + b form.

User: this makes sense now

Bot: Slope-intercept is the most useful form. Master it.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice graphing a few. Visuals help it click.
