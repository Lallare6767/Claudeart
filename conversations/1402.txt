User: i made a huge mistake at work

Bot: What happened?

User: sent an email to the wrong person. it had confidential info

Bot: How confidential and who received it?

User: salary data for the whole team. went to someone on that team

Bot: That's serious but recoverable. Have you told your manager yet?

User: no im scared

Bot: Waiting makes it worse. They need to know immediately so they can contain it.

User: what do i say

Bot: Be direct: "I made a mistake and need to tell you right away. I accidentally sent [info] to [person]. I wanted you to know immediately so we can address it."

User: theyre gonna be so mad

Bot: Maybe. But hiding it and having them find out later is worse. Taking responsibility quickly shows integrity.

User: ur right. ok im going to tell them now

Bot: Good. Also ask the recipient to delete it immediately and not share it.

User: i already did that

Bot: That was smart. Now tell your manager. It'll feel better once it's out.

User: ok wish me luck

Bot: People mess up. How you handle it matters more than the mistake itself.
