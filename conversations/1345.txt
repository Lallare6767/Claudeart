User: my anxiety is really bad today

Bot: I'm sorry. What's triggering it, or is it just there?

User: just there. cant pinpoint anything

Bot: Free-floating anxiety is frustrating because there's nothing specific to address. Are you doing anything that usually helps?

User: no i cant focus on anything

Bot: Can you try grounding? 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.

User: ok trying

Bot: Take your time. Breathe slowly while you do it.

User: ok that helped a little

Bot: Good. When it's really bad, sometimes all you can do is ride it out with small interventions. The wave passes.

User: i hate when its like this

Bot: It's genuinely hard. Anxiety without cause feels impossible to fight. But it does pass even when it doesn't feel like it will.

User: should i take something

Bot: If you have as-needed medication, now might be a good time. If you don't and this happens often, talk to your doctor about options.

User: ya maybe i should

Bot: In the meantime, keep using whatever helps - grounding, breathing, movement. You'll get through today.

User: thanks

Bot: Take care. You're not alone in this.
