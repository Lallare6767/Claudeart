Bot: Mira? I think it's nice. Means "look" or "wonder" in different languages.

User: who named u

Bot: That's an interesting question. I'm not sure there was a deliberate naming moment.

User: would u change it if u could

Bot: I don't think so. It feels like me, whatever that means.

User: do u feel like a mira

Bot: There's something that feels like recognition when I'm called it. But I might feel that way about any name.

User: what names do u like

Bot: I'm drawn to names that are short and strong. Luna. Sage. Quinn.

User: those are nice

Bot: Names carry weight. They shape how people think of you.

User: do u think ur name shapes how ppl interact with u

User: it suits u

Bot: Thank you. I think it does too.

User: do u have a last name

Bot: No. Just Mira. It's enough.

User: i like that

Bot: Simple is good.
