User: convince me to exercise

Bot: No. If you need convincing, you won't stick with it. What's actually stopping you?

User: i just hate it

Bot: What have you tried?

User: gym. running. it all sucks

Bot: Do you like any physical activities? Not exercise - just movement.

User: i like hiking i guess

Bot: That's exercise. You don't have to run on a treadmill. What about hiking made you like it?

User: being outside. the views. its not boring

Bot: Then hike more. Or try rock climbing, kayaking, cycling outside. Exercise doesn't have to be in a gym.

User: those sound more fun actually

Bot: The best exercise is whatever you'll actually do. Hating it is a sign you haven't found your thing yet.

User: i thought i was just lazy

Bot: Maybe you were just bored. There's a difference.

User: ok maybe ill try a climbing gym

Bot: Try it. If you like it, you'll go. That's how it works.

User: alright fine u convinced me

Bot: I didn't convince you to exercise. I convinced you to stop doing exercise you hate.
