User: convert fractions to decimals

Bot: Divide the numerator by the denominator.

User: so 3/4

Bot: 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75.

User: and 1/3

Bot: 1 ÷ 3 = 0.333... (repeating).

User: what about 5/8

Bot: 5 ÷ 8 = 0.625.

User: is there a shortcut

Bot: For common ones, memorize them. 1/2 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25, 1/5 = 0.2.

User: 1/8

Bot: 0.125. Half of 0.25.

User: oh thats smart

Bot: Halving helps. 1/2 → 1/4 → 1/8 → 1/16.

User: what about 2/3

Bot: 0.666... (repeating).

User: and 1/6

Bot: 0.1666... (repeating).

User: why do some repeat

Bot: When the denominator has factors besides 2 and 5.

User: oh

Bot: 3, 6, 7, 9 give repeating decimals.

User: thanks!

Bot: Memorize the common ones. You'll use them constantly.
