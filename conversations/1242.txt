User: i cant stop comparing myself to others

Bot: Everyone does it. The question is whether you use it as information or torture.

User: torture mostly

Bot: Then you're comparing yourself to people's highlights while ignoring their struggles. You're running a rigged race.

User: how do i stop

Bot: You probably won't completely. But you can reframe it. When you catch yourself comparing, ask: "Is this actually useful? Does it motivate me or just hurt?"

User: it mostly hurts

Bot: Then it's serving no purpose. You're choosing to feel bad for no gain.

User: i dont choose it, it just happens

Bot: The comparison happens automatically. What you do with it is a choice. You can notice it and redirect, or you can dwell on it. Dwelling is the choice.

User: thats hard

Bot: It is. But the alternative is a lifetime of feeling inadequate compared to whoever you decide to measure against.

User: what should i compare against instead

Bot: Yourself from last year. That's the only comparison that matters - are you better than you were? If yes, you're on track.

User: ok ill try that

Bot: Good. It takes practice to break the pattern. Be patient with yourself.
