User: how do i solve word problems

Bot: Translate words to math. That's the core skill.

User: i panic when i see them

Bot: Read slowly. Multiple times. Identify what's asked.

User: then what

Bot: Assign variables. What don't you know? That's x.

User: example

Bot: "Sam has twice as many apples as Tom. Together they have 18. How many does each have?"

User: ok

Bot: Let Tom's apples = x. Sam's = 2x. Together: x + 2x = 18.

User: 3x = 18. x = 6

Bot: So Tom has 6 and Sam has...

User: 12. check: 6 + 12 = 18. yes!

Bot: Perfect. The translation is the hard part.

User: any tips for translating

Bot: "Is" means =. "More than" means +. "Twice" means 2×. Learn the keywords.

User: "less than"

Bot: Subtraction. But watch order. "3 less than x" is x - 3.

User: not 3 - x

Bot: Right. Read carefully.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Practice is the only way. Do many word problems until patterns emerge.
