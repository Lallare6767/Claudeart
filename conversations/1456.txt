User: i said something mean and i feel terrible

Bot: What did you say and to whom?

User: told my friend their new business idea was stupid. in front of other people

Bot: Why did you say it like that?

User: i was frustrated about something else and took it out on them

Bot: Have you apologized?

User: not yet. i dont know what to say

Bot: Be direct: "I'm sorry. What I said was mean and I shouldn't have said it, especially in front of others. Your idea doesn't deserve that, and you definitely don't."

User: what if they dont forgive me

Bot: Then you deal with that. But not apologizing guarantees the damage stays. Apologizing gives it a chance to heal.

User: should i explain i was frustrated

Bot: Briefly, but don't make it an excuse. "I was frustrated about something unrelated and took it out on you. That's an explanation, not an excuse."

User: ok. i really feel awful

Bot: That's appropriate. You hurt someone you care about. The guilt means your values are intact.

User: im gonna call them now

Bot: Good. The sooner the better. And mean it.
