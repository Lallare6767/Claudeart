User: i get defensive easily

Bot: When?

User: when people give feedback. or ask questions

Bot: What does defensive feel like?

User: attacked. like i have to justify myself

Bot: Even when they're not attacking?

User: yeah. i know they're not. but it still feels that way

Bot: What are you protecting?

User: my competence i guess. or self-image

Bot: So feedback feels like threat to identity.

User: yeah

Bot: That makes sense but it's not serving you.

User: i know

Bot: Try this: when you feel defensive, pause. Don't respond immediately.

User: ok

Bot: Then ask yourself: is this attack or information?

User: usually information

Bot: Right. And information is useful, even if uncomfortable.

User: how do i not feel attacked though

Bot: Work on separating performance from worth. You can make mistakes and still be good.

User: thats hard

Bot: Yes. But necessary. Defensiveness blocks growth.

User: ok ill work on it

Bot: Notice it first. Then pause. Then respond. The pause is key.
