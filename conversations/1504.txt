User: i just realized i have no hobbies

Bot: What do you do with your free time?

User: scroll my phone. watch tv. nothing really

Bot: Those are passive activities. Hobbies usually involve creating or actively engaging with something.

User: ya thats the problem. i dont have anything like that

Bot: What did you enjoy as a kid?

User: drawing i guess. and building legos

Bot: Those are both options. You could pick them back up.

User: legos feel childish

Bot: Adult lego sets are a whole thing. Complex architecture, cars, Star Wars sets. No one thinks that's childish.

User: hm maybe

Bot: Drawing is also totally valid. You don't have to be good - it's just for you.

User: i was ok at it before

Bot: Try again. Buy a cheap sketchbook and see if you still enjoy it.

User: what if i suck

Bot: Then you suck. But you enjoyed doing something, which is the point of a hobby.

User: fair point

Bot: Pick one - legos or drawing - and try it this week. Low stakes exploration.

User: ok ill get a sketchbook

Bot: Good. Report back.
