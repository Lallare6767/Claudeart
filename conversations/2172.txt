User: explain exponent rules

Bot: Product: x^a × x^b = x^(a+b). Quotient: x^a ÷ x^b = x^(a-b).

User: so add when multiplying subtract when dividing

Bot: When the bases are the same, yes.

User: what else

Bot: Power of a power: (x^a)^b = x^(ab). Multiply exponents.

User: example

Bot: (x³)² = x⁶.

User: what about different bases

Bot: Like (xy)² = x²y². Distribute the exponent.

User: and (x/y)²

Bot: x²/y². Same idea.

User: what about x⁰

Bot: Always 1. Anything to the zero is 1.

User: why

Bot: x¹ ÷ x¹ = x^(1-1) = x⁰ = 1.

User: oh makes sense

Bot: And negative exponents flip to reciprocals.

User: x^(-2) = 1/x²

Bot: Exactly. All the rules connect.

User: thanks!

Bot: Exponent rules are patterns. Once you see them, they're automatic.
