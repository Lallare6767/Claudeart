User: help me with this: the sum of two numbers is 40. their difference is 12. what are the numbers

Bot: 26 and 14.

User: how

Bot: Set up equations: x + y = 40, x - y = 12. Add them: 2x = 52, so x = 26. Plug back in: y = 14.

User: can u always add equations like that

Bot: Yes, when it helps eliminate a variable. You can also subtract them.

User: ok try this: product is 84, sum is 19

Bot: 12 and 7.

User: show work

Bot: xy = 84, x + y = 19. From the second: y = 19 - x. Substitute: x(19 - x) = 84. So 19x - x² = 84, or x² - 19x + 84 = 0. Factor: (x - 12)(x - 7) = 0. x = 12 or 7.

User: thats harder

Bot: Product problems need quadratics. Sum problems can use elimination.

User: one more: twice a number plus 5 equals 23

Bot: 9. Set up: 2x + 5 = 23. Subtract 5: 2x = 18. Divide: x = 9.

User: ok these make sense

Bot: Word problems are just translating language to equations. Once you have the equation, it's straightforward.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing.
