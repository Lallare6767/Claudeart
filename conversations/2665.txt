User: whens its vs its'

Bot: "It's" is only for "it is" or "it has." "Its" is possessive. There's no "its'" at all.

User: wait thats backwards from normal

Bot: Right. Possessive pronouns don't use apostrophes. His, hers, its.

User: but names do

Bot: Yes. "John's book" has apostrophe. "Its pages" does not.

User: this is confusing

Bot: It's the most common error. You're not alone.

User: examples

Bot: "It's raining" = it is raining. "The dog wagged its tail" = the tail belongs to the dog.

User: so if i can say "it is" its the apostrophe one

Bot: Exactly. That's the test.

User: its really confusing

Bot: *It's :)

User: ugh

Bot: You'll get it. Just pause and expand "it is" in your head.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Soon it'll be automatic.
