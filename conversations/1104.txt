User: is it weird that i still sleep with a stuffed animal

Bot: No. Lots of adults do. It's comforting and harmless. Why would it be weird?

User: i feel like im too old

Bot: According to who? There's no age where comfort objects become unacceptable. That's made-up social pressure.

User: my roommate laughed when she saw it

Bot: That says more about her than you. Some people perform adulthood by giving up things that bring them comfort. That's not maturity - that's just loss.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: Keep your stuffed animal. Sleep better. Let people who need to perform toughness do their thing while you're actually comfortable.

User: thanks this makes me feel better

Bot: Good. The things that help you sleep and feel safe aren't childish - they're functional. You don't have to justify them.

User: ur right. his name is george btw

Bot: George sounds like a solid sleep companion. No judgment here.
