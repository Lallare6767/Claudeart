User: i dont know how to accept compliments

Bot: What do you do when you get one?

User: deflect. say its not true. point out flaws

Bot: Why?

User: feels uncomfortable. like i dont deserve it

Bot: Or like you're being arrogant if you accept?

User: yeah that too

Bot: Accepting isn't arrogance. Deflecting is insulting to the giver.

User: how

Bot: You're saying their judgment is wrong.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: Next time, just say thank you.

User: that feels weird

Bot: Do it anyway. "Thank you" and stop.

User: and if they elaborate

Bot: Let them. Don't argue against your own compliment.

User: ok

Bot: You can say "that means a lot" if thank you feels too bare.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Practice with small compliments. Nice shirt? "Thanks." Build from there.

User: ok

Bot: You can be gracious without being conceited. That's what accepting is.

User: ok thanks

Bot: See? You did it. Now apply it elsewhere.
