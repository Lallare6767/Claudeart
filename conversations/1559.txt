User: im scared im becoming my mom

Bot: In what ways?

User: the things i say to people. how i react when im stressed. i hear her voice coming out of my mouth

Bot: That's common. We internalize patterns from childhood.

User: but shes not someone i want to be

Bot: What specifically don't you like?

User: critical. negative. plays the victim

Bot: Do you actually do those things or just worry you will?

User: i catch myself doing them sometimes

Bot: Catching yourself is the key part. You're aware.

User: but awareness doesnt stop it

Bot: No but it lets you course correct. "I'm doing the thing. I'm going to stop."

User: is that enough

Bot: Over time yes. Patterns weaken when you consistently interrupt them. New patterns form.

User: i dont want to be like her

Bot: You're not her. You're you with some of her patterns. You can unlearn those and keep what's actually yours.

User: that distinction helps

Bot: Therapy is good for this specific issue - figuring out what's inherited versus chosen.

User: ya maybe i should go

Bot: Breaking generational patterns is real work. You don't have to do it alone.
