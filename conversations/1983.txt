User: what is cognitive dissonance

Bot: Holding two conflicting beliefs causes mental discomfort.

User: like what

Bot: "I'm a good person" + "I did something hurtful" = dissonance.

User: how do people resolve it

Bot: Usually by changing one belief. Either "I'm not that good" or "What I did wasn't that bad."

User: which is better

Bot: Depends on accuracy. Often people minimize the bad action to protect their self-image.

User: thats not good

Bot: It's human. But yeah, leads to justifying bad behavior.

User: how do u avoid it

Bot: Sit with the discomfort. Accept that good people can do bad things.

User: that makes sense

Bot: Growth requires holding contradictions without resolving them too quickly.

User: can u give another example

Bot: "I value health" + "I smoke" = dissonance. Often resolved by downplaying risks.

User: i see it everywhere now

Bot: Once you know what it is, you can't unsee it. Including in yourself.

User: thanks for explaining

Bot: The more you understand your mind, the better choices you make.
