User: im jealous of my friend and i feel bad about it

Bot: Jealous of what specifically?

User: they got the job i wanted. at the company i applied to

Bot: That's hard. Do you think they got it over you or just got lucky?

User: probably more qualified honestly. but it still hurts

Bot: Two things can be true - they deserved it and you're still allowed to feel bad about not getting it.

User: i know but i feel like a bad friend

Bot: Jealousy doesn't make you bad. Acting on jealousy badly would. You can be happy for them and sad for yourself simultaneously.

User: its hard to do both

Bot: It is. Can you tell them congratulations genuinely?

User: ya i did. it was sincere

Bot: That's what matters. Your private feelings are your business. Your actions are what affect the friendship.

User: so its ok to feel this way

Bot: Yes. Feelings aren't moral or immoral - they just are. You don't control them. You control what you do with them.

User: i guess i just need time

Bot: Time and maybe using it to motivate yourself to keep pursuing what you want.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You're being a good friend even while hurting. That's not nothing.
