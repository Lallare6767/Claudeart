User: what if i never find love

Bot: What makes you think that?

User: im 35 and single

Bot: 35 isn't a deadline.

User: feels like it

Bot: Lots of people find partners in their 30s, 40s, beyond.

User: but everyone's already paired up

Bot: Not everyone. Your pool changes, not disappears.

User: im tired of trying

Bot: Trying how? Apps?

User: yeah and they suck

Bot: They do. But also hobbies, activities, mutual friends.

User: i just want it to happen naturally

Bot: "Naturally" requires putting yourself in situations where it can happen.

User: i know

Bot: Are you happy alone? Or are you lonely?

User: lonely

Bot: Then keep trying. But also work on the lonely part.

User: what do u mean

Bot: Being desperate drives people away. Being whole attracts them.

User: how do i get whole

Bot: Friends, purpose, interests. A full life you'd be happy to share.

User: ok

Bot: Love might come. But a good life doesn't require it.
