User: i cant decide if i should cut my hair short

Bot: What's making you hesitate?

User: what if it looks bad

Bot: Hair grows back. It's one of the lowest-risk experiments you can make.

User: but itll take forever to grow out again

Bot: Define forever. Six months to a year depending on length. That's not that long in the span of your life.

User: i guess. i just keep thinking about what ifs

Bot: The what-if cuts both ways. What if you love it? What if you've been missing a look that suits you better?

User: true

Bot: Here's the thing: you've been thinking about it, which means you want to try it. If you don't, you'll always wonder.

User: ya i think ur right

Bot: Worst case: it looks bad, you wear hats for a few months, it grows back. Best case: you find a new look you love. The asymmetry favors doing it.

User: ok im gonna book an appointment

Bot: Good. Take a picture of what you want so the stylist has a reference. And then commit - don't second-guess in the chair.

User: ok thanks for talking me into it

Bot: You were already there. I just helped you see it.
