User: my friend ditched me for her boyfriend again

Bot: How many times has this happened?

User: like 5 times in 2 months

Bot: That's a pattern. Have you talked to her about it?

User: no. i dont want drama

Bot: Telling a friend how you feel isn't drama. It's communication.

User: shell get defensive

Bot: Maybe. But you're already upset. Silence isn't helping.

User: i just feel unimportant

Bot: That's valid. Her actions are communicating something.

User: that hes more important

Bot: Or that she doesn't realize the impact. Talk to her.

User: what do i even say

Bot: "When you cancel on me for him, I feel like I don't matter."

User: thats direct

Bot: Direct is good. No room for misunderstanding.

User: what if she doesnt care

Bot: Then you learned something important about the friendship.

User: that would suck

Bot: Yes. But better to know than keep getting hurt.
