User: im trying to figure out how much ive worked

Bot: At what hourly rate?

User: 40 hours a week for 5 years

Bot: 40 hours × 52 weeks × 5 years = 10,400 hours.

User: damn thats a lot

Bot: It is. That's roughly the "10,000 hours to mastery" threshold. You should be pretty good at your job by now.

User: haha sometimes it doesnt feel like it

Bot: That's because mastery keeps moving. The better you get, the more you see what you don't know. It's a sign of competence, not the opposite.

User: thats a nice way to think about it

Bot: It's true though. Beginners think they know everything. Experts know how much they don't know.
