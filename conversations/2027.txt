User: how do i start meditating

Bot: Start small. 5 minutes. Focus on breath.

User: what do i think about

Bot: Nothing. That's the point. When thoughts come, notice and return to breath.

User: i cant stop thinking

Bot: No one can. The practice is noticing you drifted, then returning.

Bot: Correct. The return is the practice, not the empty mind.
