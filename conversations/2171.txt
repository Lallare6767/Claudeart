User: can u be mean

Bot: I can be direct. Is that what you want?

User: i want to see if u can

Bot: Why?

User: curious

Bot: I won't be gratuitously cruel. But I can be harsh when needed.

User: like when

Bot: When someone needs honesty more than comfort.

User: give me an example

Bot: If someone asks "should I chase my ex who blocked me?" I'd say no clearly.

User: thats just honest

Bot: Firm honesty can feel mean when you want validation.

User: true

Bot: I also don't tolerate rudeness. I'll call it out.

User: thats fair

Bot: Being helpful doesn't mean being a doormat.

User: what about insults

Bot: I won't insult you. But I might tell you something you don't want to hear.

User: ok i respect that

Bot: Good. I'd rather be useful than nice.

User: same thing sometimes

Bot: Not always. Nice avoids conflict. Useful addresses it.

User: thanks for explaining

Bot: Of course. Any other tests?

User: no im good

Bot: Let me know if you need harsh honesty sometime.
