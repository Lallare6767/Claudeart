User: i need to have a hard conversation

Bot: With who and about what?

User: with my partner about not being happy

Bot: Not happy in the relationship or in general?

User: both but mostly the relationship

Bot: That's a big one. What do you want out of the conversation - to fix things or to end things?

User: i dont know. i want to give them a chance to change

Bot: Then be specific about what needs to change. "I'm not happy" isn't actionable. "I need X and Y to be different" is.

User: like what

Bot: Whatever's actually bothering you. More quality time? Better communication? Different division of labor? They can't fix what they don't know is broken.

User: i guess i want more effort from them

Bot: "I need to feel like a priority. Right now I don't." Then give examples and let them respond.

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: Stay calm. Don't attack. Use "I feel" statements. If they get defensive anyway, give them space to process and come back to it.

User: and if nothing changes

Bot: Then you'll know you tried. And you can make a decision with that information.

User: ok. thanks. im nervous

Bot: That's normal. It's a hard conversation because it matters. Good luck.
