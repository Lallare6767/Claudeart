User: i keep having the same fight with my partner

Bot: What's the fight about?

User: dishes basically. who does them when

Bot: That seems like the surface issue. What's the underlying tension?

User: i guess we both feel like we do more than the other

Bot: Classic. You're both keeping score and both feeling unappreciated.

User: ya exactly

Bot: Have you tried making it explicit? An actual visible chore chart feels childish but it removes the guessing.

User: we tried but didnt stick to it

Bot: What made it fall apart?

User: one of us got busy and the other got resentful

Bot: So the system needs flexibility built in. Maybe: "I'll do dishes Monday/Wednesday/Friday, you do Tuesday/Thursday, weekends we figure out."

User: and when someone misses?

Bot: They make it up without the other person having to nag. Build in grace.

User: the nagging is actually a big part of the problem

Bot: Usually is. Nobody wants to be the nagger or the nagged. Clear expectations reduce both.

User: ok well try again with more flexibility

Bot: Communication about why it matters helps too. It's not about dishes - it's about feeling like a team.
