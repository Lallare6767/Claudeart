User: why do i always self sabotage

Bot: What are you sabotaging specifically?

User: everything. relationships, job opportunities, health goals

Bot: What happens when things start going well?

User: i get uncomfortable and find ways to mess it up

Bot: That's a common pattern. Often it's because success feels unfamiliar or you don't believe you deserve it.

User: i think thats it. i dont feel like i deserve good things

Bot: Where did that belief come from?

User: probably childhood. was always told not to get "too big for my britches"

Bot: So you were taught that success is dangerous - that you'd be punished for it. Now you punish yourself preemptively.

User: damn. when u put it that way

Bot: The good news is beliefs can change. But it takes conscious work to override early programming.

User: like what

Bot: Notice when the sabotage urge hits. What's the feeling? What's the fear? Then choose differently even when it's uncomfortable.

User: easier said than done

Bot: Of course. That's why therapy helps - having someone to catch your patterns with you.

User: ya maybe i should try that

Bot: You deserve good things. Start acting like it and see what happens.
