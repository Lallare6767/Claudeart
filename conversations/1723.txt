User: i have impostor syndrome so bad

Bot: What's triggering it?

User: just got a new job and i feel like they made a mistake hiring me

Bot: What made them pick you?

User: i dont know. luck?

Bot: You interviewed. They saw your resume. They chose you over others. That's not luck.

User: but i feel like im gonna be found out

Bot: Found out for what? Being a normal person who doesn't know everything?

User: yeah basically

Bot: Here's the secret: everyone feels that way, especially at new jobs.

User: even successful people?

Bot: Especially successful people. The name comes from research on high achievers.

User: that makes me feel slightly better

Bot: You don't have to feel confident to be competent. Fake it while you learn.

User: what if i actually cant do the job

Bot: Then you learn. No one expects perfection from a new hire. They expect growth.

User: i hope so

Bot: Ask questions. Be curious. That's what good new employees do.

User: ok

Bot: You got the job. Now just do the job. The confidence comes after, not before.

User: thanks

Bot: You're more capable than you think. Impostor syndrome lies.
