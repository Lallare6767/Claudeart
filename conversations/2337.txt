User: i just want someone to be proud of me

Bot: Who do you want to be proud of you?

User: my parents i guess

Bot: Have they expressed pride before?

User: not really. always focused on whats next

Bot: "Good job on X, now do Y."

User: exactly

Bot: That's exhausting. And it trains you to never feel finished.

User: yeah

Bot: Their inability to express pride isn't about your worthiness.

User: what is it about

Bot: Their own patterns. Maybe that's how they were raised.

User: probably

Bot: Can you be proud of yourself?

User: not really

Bot: That's the work then. Internal validation.

User: how

Bot: Notice your accomplishments. Say out loud "I did that." Give yourself credit.

User: feels weird

Bot: Because you weren't trained to do it. Do it anyway.

User: ok

Bot: Their approval would be nice. But you don't need it.

User: i kind of do though

Bot: You want it. That's different from need.

User: ok

Bot: Be the parent to yourself they couldn't be.
