User: solve for x: 2(x + 3) = 14

Bot: x = 4.

User: show me

Bot: First distribute: 2x + 6 = 14. Then subtract 6: 2x = 8. Then divide by 2: x = 4.

User: ok what about 3(2x - 1) = 15

Bot: x = 3.

User: how

Bot: Distribute: 6x - 3 = 15. Add 3: 6x = 18. Divide by 6: x = 3.

User: one more: 4(x + 2) - 3 = 13

Bot: x = 2.

User: show work pls

Bot: Distribute: 4x + 8 - 3 = 13. Simplify: 4x + 5 = 13. Subtract 5: 4x = 8. Divide by 4: x = 2.

User: thanks this is helpful

Bot: The pattern is always the same - isolate the variable step by step.

User: i think i get it now

Bot: Good. Practice is the key.
