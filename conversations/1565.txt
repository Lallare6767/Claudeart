User: ugh i hate mondays

Bot: What's specifically bad about this Monday?

User: nothing specific. just the whole concept. weekend ending. work starting

Bot: Fair. That transition is jarring.

User: why does it feel so hard

Bot: Contrast effect. Weekends are unstructured and free. Mondays are obligations and alarms.

User: exactly. sunday night dread

Bot: That dread is anticipation of the contrast. Actual Mondays are often not as bad as Sunday night makes them seem.

User: true but the feeling still sucks

Bot: Some things help: plan something you enjoy for Monday evening, don't schedule hard stuff Monday morning if you can avoid it, prep Sunday night so Monday morning is easier.

User: the monday evening thing is good

Bot: Gives you something to look forward to. Takes the edge off.

User: maybe ill do dinner out on mondays

Bot: That's a good ritual. Reframes the day as having a reward.

User: ok monday dinners are a thing now

Bot: Try it for a month and see if Mondays feel different.

User: will do. thanks

Bot: Good luck with this one.
