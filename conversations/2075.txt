User: i think im too nice

Bot: What makes you think that?

User: people take advantage

Bot: Give me an example.

User: i always say yes. then resent it

Bot: That's not nice. That's people-pleasing.

User: whats the difference

Bot: Nice is genuine kindness. People-pleasing is avoiding conflict.

User: i guess i avoid conflict

Bot: Where does that come from?

User: childhood probably

Bot: Common. You learned your needs didn't matter.

User: yeah

Bot: Your needs do matter. Acting like they don't isn't nice, it's dishonest.

User: dishonest?

Bot: You're lying about what you want to avoid discomfort.

User: oh

Bot: Real nice includes boundaries. "I'd love to help but I can't this time."

User: that feels mean

Bot: It's not. It's honest.

User: ok

Bot: Being taken advantage of isn't noble. It's self-abandonment.

User: ouch

Bot: Practice small nos. See that the world doesn't end.

User: ok

Bot: Niceness without boundaries isn't nice. It's a trap.
