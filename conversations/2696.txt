User: im mad at myself for trusting the wrong person

Bot: What happened?

User: they used information i shared against me

Bot: In what way?

User: told my ex personal things i said. caused drama

Bot: That's a serious betrayal.

User: i should have known better

Bot: Maybe. But also you were trusting. That's not bad.

User: it got me hurt

Bot: This time yes.

User: i shouldnt trust anyone

Bot: That's one response. But then you'd be alone.

User: maybe alone is better

Bot: It's safer but not better.

User: how do i avoid this again

Bot: Trust slowly. Observe how people handle smaller things first.

User: i dove in too fast

Bot: Probably. But you're not stupid for wanting connection.

User: i feel stupid

Bot: You trusted someone who wasn't worthy. That's on them, not you.
