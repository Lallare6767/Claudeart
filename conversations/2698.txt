User: how do i convert celsius to fahrenheit

Bot: Multiply by 9/5, then add 32.

User: example

Bot: 20°C × 9/5 = 36. Then 36 + 32 = 68°F.

User: another one

Bot: 0°C × 9/5 = 0. Plus 32 = 32°F.

User: thats freezing

Bot: Exactly. 0°C = 32°F. Water freezes.

User: what about other way

Bot: Subtract 32, then multiply by 5/9.

User: so 98.6°F

Bot: 98.6 - 32 = 66.6. Times 5/9 = 37°C.

User: body temperature

Bot: Yep.

User: is there a quick estimate

Bot: Double the Celsius, then add 30. Gets you close.

User: so 20 C is about 70

Bot: Yeah. Real answer is 68 but close enough.

User: thats easier

Bot: For rough estimates it works.
