User: my sister just had a baby and im not excited

Bot: Is that surprising to you?

User: ya. i thought id feel something but i dont

Bot: What do you think that's about?

User: i dont know. we're not that close maybe

Bot: That's allowed. Not all siblings are close. You don't have to perform excitement you don't feel.

User: but everyone expects me to be excited

Bot: Social pressure. Babies are supposed to be universally exciting. But you're allowed to feel neutral.

User: will i be a bad aunt

Bot: Only if you're unkind to the child. You can be a good aunt without being baby-crazy.

User: i guess ill feel more connected when they're older

Bot: Possibly. Some people connect better with kids than babies. Babies don't do much.

User: lol true

Bot: You can be happy for your sister without being personally excited. Those are different things.

User: ya i am happy for her

Bot: Then you're fine. You don't have to match everyone else's emotional response.

User: ok. that helps

Bot: Give it time. Relationships with niblings develop over years.

User: niblings?

Bot: Nieces and nephews. Non-gendered term.

User: oh cute. thanks

Bot: Good luck with all of it.
