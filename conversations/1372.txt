User: whats 15% of 340

Bot: 51.

User: how did u calculate that

Bot: 10% of 340 is 34. 5% is half of that, so 17. Add them: 34 + 17 = 51.

User: oh thats a good shortcut

Bot: It works for any percentage. Break it into easier chunks you can do mentally.

User: so what about 23% of 500

Bot: 20% of 500 is 100. 3% of 500 is 15. Total: 115.

User: nice. what about 7.5% of 200

Bot: 10% is 20, so 5% is 10, and 2.5% is 5. So 5% + 2.5% = 10 + 5 = 15.

User: wait lemme try one. 35% of 80

Bot: Go ahead.

User: 10% is 8, so 30% is 24, and 5% is 4. so 28?

Bot: Perfect. You've got it.

User: this is way easier than just multiplying decimals

Bot: Mental math shortcuts make a big difference. Practice a few more and it'll become automatic.
