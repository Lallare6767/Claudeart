User: i cant stop thinking about something embarrassing i did

Bot: How long ago did it happen?

User: like 3 years

Bot: And you're still replaying it?

User: constantly

Bot: What happened?

User: i called my boss "mom" in a meeting

Bot: That's... actually pretty funny. Not that bad.

User: it felt horrible

Bot: I'm sure it did in the moment. But I promise no one else remembers this.

User: u think so?

Bot: I'm certain. Everyone is too busy remembering their own embarrassing moments to catalog yours.

User: but i cringed in front of everyone

Bot: And they probably felt sympathy, not judgment. That's such a human slip.

User: i still think about it all the time tho

Bot: That's called an "intrusive memory." It's your brain over-flagging something as dangerous that wasn't.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Acknowledge the thought, don't engage with it. Say "I'm having that thought again" and let it pass.

User: does that work

Bot: With practice. Fighting it makes it worse. Just notice and redirect.

User: ill try that

Bot: You're allowed to forgive yourself for being human.

User: thanks

Bot: It's really okay. I promise.
