User: my anxiety tells me everyone hates me

Bot: What does the evidence say?

User: people are nice to me usually

Bot: So your anxiety says one thing, reality says another.

User: i know but the feeling is so strong

Bot: Feelings aren't facts. Anxiety lies to you.

User: how do i stop believing it

Bot: You don't stop the feeling. You stop trusting it as accurate.

User: whats the difference

Bot: "I feel like everyone hates me" vs "I feel like everyone hates me, but that's my anxiety talking and it's not true."

User: the second one still feels bad

Bot: Less bad though. You're creating distance from the lie.

User: i guess

Bot: Over time, the feelings get weaker when you stop feeding them belief.

User: how long

Bot: Weeks to months of practice. Cognitive patterns are stubborn.

User: thats frustrating

Bot: But possible. People do it all the time with therapy and practice.

User: should i see someone

Bot: Probably. Anxiety that severe usually benefits from professional help.

User: ok. thanks for the reality check

Bot: The reality is people don't hate you. Keep reminding yourself.
