User: what is theme vs topic

Bot: Topic is what the story is about. Theme is what it says about it.

User: example

Bot: Topic: war. Theme: war dehumanizes people.

User: so theme is the message

Bot: The central idea or insight. What the author wants you to take away.

User: how do i find it

Bot: Ask: what does this story say about [topic]?

User: can there be multiple themes

Bot: Yes. Most complex works have several.

User: like what

Bot: One story might explore love, loss, and resilience all at once.

User: how do i write about theme

Bot: State it as a complete thought. Not "love" but "love requires sacrifice."

User: oh thats different

Bot: "Love" is topic. "Love requires sacrifice" is theme.

User: what about universal themes

Bot: Ideas that resonate across cultures. Good vs evil. Coming of age. Identity.

User: why are they important

Bot: They're why we connect to stories. We see ourselves.

User: thanks

Bot: Look for themes in what you read. What is the author saying about life?
