User: i think too much

Bot: About what?

User: everything. every decision. every conversation. what people think

Bot: Overthinking or rumination?

User: both

Bot: Overthinking is about the future. Rumination is about the past.

User: then both for sure

Bot: They feed each other. Past mistakes inform future worries.

User: exactly

Bot: Does thinking solve the problems?

User: no. just goes in circles

Bot: Then it's not productive thinking. It's anxiety disguised as analysis.

User: so how do i stop

Bot: Interrupt the loop. Physical activity. Set a timer for worry time.

User: worry time?

Bot: 15 minutes where you're allowed to worry. Outside that, postpone to worry time.

User: that seems weird

Bot: It works. Gives your brain a designated place for worry so it stops intruding.

User: ok

Bot: Also: your thoughts aren't facts. You can notice them without believing them.

User: thats hard

Bot: Practice. CBT helps a lot with this.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Your brain is trying to protect you. It's just doing it wrong.
