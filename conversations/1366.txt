User: im worried about my job interview tmrw

Bot: What specifically are you worried about?

User: that ill freeze up and forget everything

Bot: That's a common fear. Have you prepared answers for common questions?

User: ya but i feel like ill blank when theyre actually asking

Bot: Practice helps with that. Can you do a mock interview with someone tonight?

User: maybe my roommate can help

Bot: Good idea. Also - if you do blank, it's okay to pause and say "Let me think about that for a moment." Interviewers expect it.

User: really? that wont look bad?

Bot: No. Thoughtful pauses are better than rushed rambling. It shows you're actually considering the question.

User: ok that makes me feel a bit better

Bot: Remember - they already liked you enough to interview you. They want you to succeed.

User: i didnt think of it that way

Bot: Go practice tonight, get good sleep, and trust your preparation. You've got this.

User: ok ill try. thanks

Bot: Good luck tomorrow. You're more ready than you think.
