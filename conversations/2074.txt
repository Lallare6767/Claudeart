User: how do i multiply fractions

Bot: Multiply the tops, multiply the bottoms. (a/b) × (c/d) = ac/bd.

User: so 2/3 times 4/5

Bot: (2×4)/(3×5) = 8/15.

User: thats it?

Bot: That's it. Fractions are easiest to multiply.

User: what about 3/4 times 2/3

Bot: 6/12 = 1/2.

User: oh it simplified

Bot: Always simplify. Or cross-cancel first: 3/4 × 2/3 = 1/2 × 2/2... wait, let me show properly.

User: ok

Bot: Cancel the 3s: (3/4) × (2/3) = (1/4) × (2/1) = 2/4 = 1/2.

User: thats faster

Bot: Cross-canceling saves work. Look for shared factors.

User: what about dividing

Bot: Flip the second fraction and multiply. (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (d/c).

User: so 2/3 divided by 1/4

Bot: 2/3 × 4/1 = 8/3.

User: cool. thanks!

Bot: Fractions are easy once you know the tricks.
