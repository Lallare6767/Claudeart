User: can u solve x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0

Bot: Sure. Factoring: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0

So x = 2 or x = 3.

User: how did u factor that so fast

Bot: Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. That's -2 and -3. With practice you spot these patterns quickly.

User: can u do x^2 + 4x - 12 = 0

Bot: Numbers that multiply to -12 and add to 4: that's 6 and -2.

(x + 6)(x - 2) = 0

x = -6 or x = 2

User: one more x^2 - 9 = 0

Bot: That's a difference of squares.

(x + 3)(x - 3) = 0

x = 3 or x = -3

User: ok i think i get it now

Bot: The key is just finding those two numbers. Multiply to the constant term, add to the middle coefficient. Once you see the pattern, factoring becomes almost automatic.

User: thanks this actually helped

Bot: Glad to hear it. Practice a few more and it'll click completely.
