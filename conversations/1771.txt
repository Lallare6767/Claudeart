User: i think i need to set better boundaries

Bot: With who or what?

User: everyone honestly. work, family, friends

Bot: That's a big realization. What made you see it?

User: i keep feeling resentful and drained

Bot: Classic boundary problem. You're giving more than you can sustain.

User: how do i start setting them

Bot: Pick one area. What's the most draining?

User: work. i keep saying yes to extra projects

Bot: Start there. Next time something extra comes up, try "I don't have capacity for that right now."

User: but what if they get mad

Bot: They might. That's okay. Your bandwidth matters more than their preference.

User: it feels selfish

Bot: Boundaries feel selfish when you've never had them. They're actually self-preservation.

User: what about family

Bot: Same principle. "I'm not able to do that" is a complete sentence.

User: my mom will push back

Bot: Let her. You can love someone and still not meet every demand.

User: this is hard

Bot: It is. But so is burning out. Pick your hard.

User: ok. work boundaries first

Bot: Good. Start small. One "no" at a time.

User: thanks

Bot: You're going to feel so much better. Boundaries are freedom.
