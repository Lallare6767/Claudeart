User: what is absolute value

Bot: Distance from zero. Always positive.

User: so |-5| = 5

Bot: Correct. It's 5 units away from zero.

User: what about |3|

Bot: Also 3. Positive stays positive.

User: why is it useful

Bot: When direction doesn't matter, only magnitude.

User: example

Bot: Error measurements. You want size of error, not whether it's above or below.

User: make sense

Bot: What's |-8 + 3|?

User: um. -8 + 3 = -5. then absolute value = 5

Bot: Good. Operations inside first, then absolute value.

User: what about |x| = 7

Bot: Two solutions: x = 7 or x = -7. Both are 7 away from zero.

User: oh thats interesting

Bot: That's why absolute value equations have two answers.

User: |x| = -3?

Bot: No solution. Absolute value can't be negative.

User: right. distance is always positive

Bot: Exactly. You've got it.

User: thanks

Bot: Absolute value is simple but shows up everywhere. Know it well.
