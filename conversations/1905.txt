User: what is 4/5 divided by 2/3

Bot: 6/5, or 1 and 1/5.

User: how

Bot: Divide by a fraction = multiply by its reciprocal. So 4/5 × 3/2 = 12/10 = 6/5.

User: reciprocal means flip it

Bot: Yes. 2/3 becomes 3/2.

User: what about 3/4 divided by 5/8

Bot: 3/4 × 8/5 = 24/20 = 6/5.

User: same answer interesting

Bot: Coincidence. Try 1/2 divided by 3/4.

User: 1/2 times 4/3... 4/6 = 2/3

Bot: Perfect!

User: this is easier than i thought

Bot: The flip trick makes it simple. Just remember: divide = multiply by reciprocal.

User: why does that work

Bot: Division asks "how many of these fit into that." The reciprocal reverses the relationship.

User: that kinda makes sense

Bot: If you want to go deeper, there's math that explains it. For now, the method works.

User: ill stick with the method

Bot: Practical choice. Keep practicing.

User: thanks!

Bot: Fractions conquered.
