User: wat is standard deviation

Bot: How spread out numbers are from the average.

User: can u give example

Bot: Test scores: 70, 80, 90. Average is 80. Standard deviation tells you how far each score typically sits from 80.

User: how do u calculate it

Bot: Find the mean. Subtract mean from each value. Square those differences. Average the squares. Square root that.

User: thats a lot of steps

Bot: It is. But each step has purpose.

User: why square then square root

Bot: Squaring removes negative signs. Square rooting brings it back to original units.

User: oh that makes sense

Bot: The result is in the same units as your data. Makes interpretation easier.

User: what does a big standard deviation mean

Bot: Data is spread out. Small means clustered around the mean.

User: so its about consistency

Bot: Exactly. Low standard deviation = consistent. High = variable.

User: thanks this helps

Bot: Statistics is just asking questions about data. Standard deviation asks "how consistent?"
