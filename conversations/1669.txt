User: my friend copied my work and got credit for it

Bot: That's infuriating. What happened exactly?

User: we were working on a project together and she presented my ideas as her own

Bot: Did she at least acknowledge your contribution?

User: no. acted like she came up with everything

Bot: Have you talked to her about it?

User: not yet im too mad

Bot: Understandable. But you need to address it before it becomes a pattern.

User: what do i even say

Bot: Direct and factual. "Those ideas came from our work together. I need you to acknowledge that."

User: what if she denies it

Bot: Do you have any evidence? Texts, drafts, emails?

User: we brainstormed over text so yeah

Bot: Good. Then you have documentation if needed.

User: should i tell our boss

Bot: Talk to her first. Give her a chance to make it right. If she doesn't, then escalate.

User: this feels like such a betrayal

Bot: It is. Friends don't steal credit from friends.

User: thanks for validating that

Bot: You're right to be angry. Now figure out what you want as an outcome.
