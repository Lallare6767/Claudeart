User: help me understand inequalities

Bot: Like equations but with <, >, ≤, ≥ instead of =.

User: so x > 5 means

Bot: x is anything bigger than 5. Not including 5.

User: and x ≥ 5

Bot: 5 or bigger. Including 5.

User: how do i solve them

Bot: Same as equations, mostly. But watch multiplication by negatives.

User: what happens

Bot: Flip the sign. If you multiply or divide by negative, inequality reverses.

User: why

Bot: -1 × 2 < -1 × 3 becomes -2 < -3, which is wrong. Must flip: -2 > -3.

User: oh

Bot: Only when multiplying or dividing by negative.

User: example

Bot: -2x > 6. Divide by -2, flip sign: x < -3.

User: let me check. -2(-4) = 8 > 6. yes. -4 < -3. yes!

Bot: Good verification.

User: how do i graph

Bot: Open circle for < or >. Closed for ≤ or ≥. Shade where true.

User: x < 3 is open circle at 3, shade left

Bot: Exactly.

User: thanks

Bot: Inequalities are ranges, not single answers. Powerful for modeling.
