User: i just want to vent can you listen

Bot: Of course. Go ahead.

User: i am so sick of my sister

Bot: What's going on?

User: she always makes everything about her. always

Bot: Can you give me an example?

User: i told her i got a raise and she immediately started talking about how she deserves one too

Bot: So she didn't acknowledge you at all.

User: exactly. it always happens

Bot: That's frustrating.

User: and then she gets offended when i pull back

Bot: She wants attention but doesn't give it.

User: yes!!! thank you

Bot: Have you talked to her about it?

User: no. she'd flip out

Bot: Maybe. But without conversation nothing changes.

User: i know

Bot: For now though, just venting?

User: yes

Bot: Then vent. She sounds exhausting.

User: she really is. thanks for listening.
