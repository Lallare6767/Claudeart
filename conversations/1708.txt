User: can u help me write a toast for my friends wedding

Bot: Of course. What's your relationship to them?

User: best man. known the groom since childhood

Bot: Perfect - you have material. What do you want the toast to feel like?

User: funny but heartfelt. not too long

Bot: Good instincts. Start with a funny story, pivot to genuine emotion, end with well wishes.

User: can u give me a structure

Bot: 1) Quick intro and thank everyone. 2) Funny story about the groom. 3) How you knew he'd found the one. 4) What you wish for them. 5) Raise glasses.

User: what kind of funny story

Bot: Something endearing, not embarrassing. Shows his character in a good light.

User: he got lost driving to his first date with her

Bot: That's perfect. Sweet and funny without being mean.

User: how do i pivot to serious

Bot: "But when he told me about her, I'd never seen him so sure of anything."

User: oh thats good

Bot: Keep it 2-3 minutes max. People have short attention spans.

User: thanks this really helps

Bot: You'll do great. Speak from the heart and you can't go wrong.

User: ill practice

Bot: Good idea. Congratulations to them.
