User: help with word problem. train leaves at 8am going 60mph. another at 9am going 80mph. when does it catch up

Bot: Classic problem. Let's set it up.

User: ok

Bot: First train has 1 hour head start. In that hour, it goes 60 miles.

User: ok

Bot: Now both are moving. Second train gains 20 mph on the first.

User: 80 - 60 = 20

Bot: Right. How long to close 60 miles at 20 mph gain?

User: 60/20 = 3 hours

Bot: So second train catches up 3 hours after it leaves. What time?

User: 9am + 3 hours = noon

Bot: Correct.

User: how far from the start

Bot: Second train goes 80 × 3 = 240 miles. They meet 240 miles away.

User: let me check first train. left at 8am, so 4 hours. 60 × 4 = 240. yes!

Bot: Good verification. Always check both sides agree.

User: these always confused me

Bot: Break them into pieces. Head start. Rate difference. Time to close gap.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice more. The pattern repeats.
