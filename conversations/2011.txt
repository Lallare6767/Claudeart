User: convert 68 fahrenheit to celsius

Bot: 20°C.

User: how

Bot: Subtract 32, then multiply by 5/9. (68-32) × 5/9 = 36 × 5/9 = 20.

User: what about 86

Bot: (86-32) × 5/9 = 54 × 5/9 = 30°C.

User: and 50

Bot: (50-32) × 5/9 = 18 × 5/9 = 10°C.

User: these are nice numbers

Bot: Those are common reference points. 50F=10C, 68F=20C, 86F=30C.

User: is there an easy rule

Bot: Rough estimate: subtract 30, divide by 2. Gets you close.

User: 68 minus 30 is 38 divided by 2 is 19

Bot: Close to 20. Good enough for quick estimates.

User: and back to fahrenheit

Bot: Multiply by 9/5, add 32. Or reverse the estimate: double it, add 30.

User: ok this helps

Bot: Those reference points (10, 20, 30°C) make conversion easier.

User: thanks!

Bot: Temperature math comes up more than you'd think.
