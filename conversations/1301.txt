User: how do i deal with imposter syndrome at work

Bot: First recognize that imposter syndrome is common among competent people. The incompetent rarely question themselves. What specific situations trigger it for you?

User: when im in meetings with senior people

Bot: You feel like you don't belong or shouldn't be speaking?

User: ya exactly

Bot: Here's the thing: they invited you to the meeting. That's not an accident. Someone thinks your perspective is valuable or you wouldn't be there.

User: but what if i say something dumb

Bot: You might. Everyone does sometimes. But staying silent because you're afraid of looking dumb is also noticed - and it's worse.

User: how do i get over it

Bot: Prepare more than you think you need to. When you know your stuff cold, confidence comes easier. Also: start small. Ask one question per meeting before trying to contribute big ideas.

User: what if the question is dumb

Bot: Questions are rarely dumb. And asking shows engagement. People respect someone who asks for clarity more than someone who pretends to understand.

User: ok maybe ill try asking more questions

Bot: Do it. You'll realize no one's judging you as harshly as you judge yourself.
