User: im having a quarter life crisis

Bot: What's it looking like for you?

User: just like what am i doing with my life and is this it

Bot: How old are you?

User: 27

Bot: Classic timing. What specifically is causing the crisis - career, relationships, general direction?

User: all of it. i thought id be further along

Bot: Further along by whose timeline? Because 27 is still really early for most things.

User: i dont know. just general expectations

Bot: Those expectations are usually absorbed from society or family, not based on anything real. What would "further along" look like specifically?

User: better job, relationship, maybe a house

Bot: Those are achievable in your 30s for most people. You're not behind - you're just comparing yourself to an imaginary timeline.

User: i guess i feel like im running out of time

Bot: You're not. But the feeling might be telling you to be more intentional about what you want. Less crisis, more direction.

User: so make some plans?

Bot: Yes. Pick the thing that matters most and focus on it. The crisis fades when you're actually moving toward something.

User: ok that makes sense. thanks

Bot: You've got time. Use it deliberately and the crisis resolves itself.
