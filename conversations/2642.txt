User: whats the difference between mean median and mode

Bot: Mean is average. Median is middle. Mode is most frequent.

User: example please

Bot: Data set: 2, 3, 3, 5, 7.

User: ok

Bot: Mean: (2+3+3+5+7)/5 = 20/5 = 4.

User: median?

Bot: Middle number when ordered. Here it's 3.

User: and mode?

Bot: 3 appears most often. Mode is 3.

User: when do you use each

Bot: Mean for typical value. Median when there are outliers. Mode for most common.

User: what about outliers

Bot: If data was 2, 3, 3, 5, 100 - mean is 22.6 but median is still 3.

User: oh median ignores the extreme value

Bot: Basically yes. That's why it's better for skewed data.

User: makes sense

Bot: Test scores: median. House prices: median. Shoe size: mode.

User: thanks this helps

Bot: Different tools for different situations.
