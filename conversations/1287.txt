User: my friend keeps borrowing money and not paying back

Bot: How much total and over what period?

User: prob like $300 over a few months in small amounts

Bot: Have they paid any of it back?

User: no and they dont bring it up

Bot: You need to have a direct conversation. "Hey, you owe me around $300 and I need that back. Can you start paying me?"

User: what if they get mad

Bot: Then they're the kind of person who borrows money and gets mad when asked to repay. That tells you something important about them.

User: i dont want to ruin the friendship

Bot: The friendship is already being damaged by their behavior. Not addressing it doesn't save it - it just makes you resentful.

User: should i stop lending to them after this

Bot: Yes. Once you've asked for repayment, don't lend again until you're fully paid back. "Sorry, I can't lend right now" is a complete sentence.

User: ya i need to be firmer

Bot: You do. Real friends don't put you in this position repeatedly. A good person would have already offered to pay you back.

User: ok ill talk to them this week

Bot: Good. You deserve to be repaid and you deserve friends who don't take advantage.
