User: is it okay to cut off family

Bot: Depends on what they've done.

User: my dad. hes toxic. mean. sometimes abusive

Bot: Then yes. Blood doesn't require you to accept mistreatment.

User: people say family is family

Bot: People who haven't been abused by family say that.

User: my mom wants me to reconcile

Bot: That's her want. Not your obligation.

User: she says he's changed

Bot: Has he apologized? Made amends?

User: no. just "mellowed"

Bot: Mellowed isn't changed. Changed includes accountability.

User: so i dont have to

Bot: You don't have to do anything. Your safety and peace come first.

User: i feel guilty

Bot: Guilt is natural. It's not the same as being wrong.

User: how do i know im not overreacting

Bot: You're not. Trust your experience. You lived it.

User: ok

Bot: Protecting yourself isn't punishment. It's survival.

User: thanks

Bot: Do what you need. Explain to those who listen. Ignore those who don't.
