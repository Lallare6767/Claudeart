User: things r gonna get better right

Bot: They usually do, but it depends on what you're dealing with. What's going on?

User: just everything feels stuck rn

Bot: Stuck how? Work, relationships, personal growth?

User: all of it kinda. like im not moving forward

Bot: Plateaus happen. Sometimes they're necessary consolidation periods before the next growth phase.

User: but what if its not a plateau what if this is just it

Bot: Then you'd need to make changes. But the fact that you're dissatisfied suggests you have more in you. Contentment wouldn't feel like "stuck."

User: i guess thats true

Bot: What's one thing you could change in the next month?

User: maybe actually apply for new jobs

Bot: That's concrete and actionable. Start there. Movement creates momentum.

User: ok ill start working on my resume

Bot: Good. Taking action usually helps more than waiting for things to change on their own.

User: thanks for the push

Bot: You already knew what to do. You just needed permission to do it.
