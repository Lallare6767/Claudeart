User: i keep saying yes to things i dont want to do

Bot: Why?

User: i feel bad saying no

Bot: Bad how?

User: like im letting people down or being mean

Bot: So you'd rather betray yourself than disappoint them.

User: ouch but yes

Bot: Every yes to something you don't want is a no to something you do.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: Your time and energy are finite. Saying no is just protecting those resources.

User: but people expect me to say yes

Bot: Because you've trained them to. You can retrain them.

User: how

Bot: Start with small nos. "I can't this week" instead of inventing excuses.

User: they wont like that

Bot: Some won't. Those are the people who like you for your yeses, not for you.

User: thats harsh

Bot: It's clarifying. Good relationships survive "no."

User: ok ill try

Bot: Practice a simple "no" in the mirror if you need to. It gets easier.

User: thanks

Bot: Protect your time. It's your most valuable resource.
