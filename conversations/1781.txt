Bot: What are you avoiding?

User: a report for work thats due tomorrow

Bot: How long will it actually take?

User: maybe 2 hours

Bot: And how long have you been procrastinating?

User: like 3 hours already

Bot: So you've spent more time avoiding it than it would take to finish.

User: when u put it like that...

Bot: Classic procrastination. The avoidance costs more than the task.

User: why do i do this

Bot: Usually because the task is boring, hard, or emotionally loaded. Which is it?

User: boring

Bot: Then the trick is getting started. The first five minutes are the hardest.

User: how do i get started

Bot: Commit to just writing the first paragraph. Nothing else. Just that.

User: and then

Bot: Momentum takes over. Or it doesn't, and you commit to the next section.

User: ok fine im gonna do it

Bot: Good. Close this conversation. Open the document. Write one sentence.

User: ok ok im going

Bot: Good luck. You'll feel so much better when it's done.
