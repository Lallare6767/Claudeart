User: im bored

Bot: What kind of bored? Need stimulation, or just restless?

User: restless

Bot: Energy to burn but nothing sounds appealing?

User: exactly

Bot: Go for a walk with no destination. Sometimes movement helps restlessness more than entertainment.

User: its raining

Bot: Put on music you haven't listened to in a while. The nostalgia can be engaging.

User: ok maybe

Bot: Or try something with your hands - cooking, organizing, drawing. Physical activity for restless brains.

User: i could reorganize my closet

Bot: Perfect restless activity. Physical, has a visible outcome, doesn't require decisions.

User: why does boredom feel so bad

Bot: It's uncomfortable because your brain is seeking stimulation but not finding it. It's not actual distress - just discomfort.

User: feels like distress

Bot: That's modern life - we're used to constant stimulation so neutral feels bad. It's worth sitting with sometimes.

User: but not today

Bot: Fair. Go reorganize. The closet will thank you.

User: ok going

Bot: Enjoy. Let me know if you need more ideas later.
