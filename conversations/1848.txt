User: i keep thinking about something embarrassing from years ago

Bot: Welcome to being human. What happened?

User: i confidently corrected someone and i was wrong

Bot: How long ago?

User: like 5 years

Bot: And you think about it how often?

User: weekly at least

Bot: Here's the thing: the other person has forgotten.

User: u dont know that

Bot: I'm certain of it. Think of every time someone corrected you wrong. Can you remember?

User: not really

Bot: Exactly. It wasn't significant to them. It was only significant to you.

User: but it was so embarrassing

Bot: To you. In the moment. They moved on immediately.

User: why do i keep replaying it

Bot: Your brain over-flagged it as a threat. It's trying to protect you from future embarrassment.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Thank the memory for trying to help, then let it pass. Don't engage with it.

User: that sounds too simple

Bot: It takes practice. Engaging with it makes it stronger.

User: ok ill try

Bot: You deserve to let this go. Five years is long enough.

User: thanks

Bot: Forgive yourself for being confidently wrong once. Everyone has been.
