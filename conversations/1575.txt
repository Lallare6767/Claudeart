Bot: What made you realize that?

User: just thinking about where i was a year ago. completely different person

Bot: What changed?

User: started therapy, set boundaries, got better at my job, actually have hobbies now

Bot: That's significant growth. Those things all compound on each other.

User: ya they do. therapy helped everything else happen

Bot: It often does. Changes your relationship with yourself which changes everything external.

User: i dont give myself credit enough

Bot: Most people don't. We adjust to our current state and forget where we started.

User: this time last year i was miserable

Bot: And now?

User: not perfect but so much better. actually enjoying life

Bot: That's everything. Progress doesn't have to be perfection.
