User: i have to give a presentation and im terrified

Bot: When is it and what's it about?

User: tomorrow. quarterly results to senior leadership

Bot: High stakes. What specifically scares you?

User: blanking. looking stupid in front of important people

Bot: Have you practiced out loud?

User: a few times in my head

Bot: Practice out loud at least twice tonight. Speaking and thinking are different - your mouth needs to know the words.

User: ok

Bot: Also - you know this material better than anyone in the room. You made the numbers. They're just hearing them.

User: i guess thats true

Bot: If you blank, pause and look at your slide. It'll prompt you. No one will notice a two-second pause.

User: what if they ask questions i cant answer

Bot: "Good question. I'll look into that and follow up." Nobody expects omniscience. Promising to follow up is professional.

User: ok that helps

Bot: You'll be nervous for the first 30 seconds, then it'll ease. Get through the opening and momentum carries you.

User: ill practice more tonight

Bot: You've got this. Tomorrow you'll wonder why you were so worried.
