User: i cant sleep and its 3am

Bot: How long have you been trying?

User: like 2 hours

Bot: At this point, get up. Don't lie in bed frustrated - it trains your brain that bed is for being awake. Go to another room, do something boring, try again when you feel sleepy.

User: like what

Bot: Read something unstimulating. No phone. Maybe warm milk if that's your thing. The goal is to be bored, not entertained.

User: this happens a lot lately

Bot: If it's recurring, there's an underlying issue. Stress, anxiety, bad sleep hygiene, or a medical thing. Worth looking into.

User: its prob stress

Bot: That'll do it. Your brain won't shut off if it's running on worry. Do you have a way to dump your thoughts before bed?

User: no not really

Bot: Try journaling for 10 minutes before sleep. Write whatever's in your head. It helps get it out of the mental loop.

User: ok ill try that tomorrow

Bot: For now, go read something boring. You'll get sleepy eventually. But seriously, address the stress thing - it won't fix itself.

User: ya ur right. thanks

Bot: Good luck. Hope you sleep soon.
