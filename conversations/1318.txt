User: i feel disconnected from my body

Bot: Disconnected how? Numb, unfamiliar, like it's not yours?

User: like im watching myself from outside

Bot: That's dissociation. It's a protective response often tied to stress, trauma, or anxiety. How often does it happen?

User: pretty often lately

Bot: Have you talked to a mental health professional about it?

User: no i thought it was just stress

Bot: It might be stress-related, but persistent dissociation is worth addressing. It can worsen if ignored.

User: is it dangerous

Bot: Not physically, but it can affect your functioning and quality of life. And it's usually pointing to something that needs attention.

User: what can help

Bot: Grounding exercises in the moment - focus on physical sensations, name what you see and hear. Long term, therapy to address the underlying cause.

User: ok maybe i should see someone

Bot: I think that would help. Dissociation is manageable but it benefits from professional support.

User: thanks. i didnt realize it was a thing that needed addressing

Bot: A lot of people don't. But you don't have to feel detached from yourself. There's help for it.
