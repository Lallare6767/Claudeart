User: why do i attract toxic people

Bot: What makes them toxic?

User: manipulative. draining. making everything about them

Bot: How many are we talking about?

User: friends. exes. coworkers

Bot: The common factor is you.

User: so its my fault

Bot: Not fault. But something about you attracts or tolerates them.

User: like what

Bot: Maybe you ignore red flags. Maybe you're drawn to intensity.

User: intensity yes

Bot: Intensity isn't love. Often it's instability.

User: but normal feels boring

Bot: That's the problem. You've mistaken chaos for passion.

User: how do i fix it

Bot: Slow down at the beginning. Intense fast connections usually crash.

User: ok

Bot: Also: notice how they treat others, not just you.

User: ok

Bot: And check your boundaries. Do you let things slide that shouldn't slide?

User: probably

Bot: Healthy people respect boundaries. Toxic ones test them.

User: ok

Bot: You can break this pattern. But you have to change your filter.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Boring might just be stable. Give it a chance.
