User: whats 2+2x2

Bot: 6. Multiplication before addition: 2 + (2×2) = 2 + 4 = 6.

User: i thought it was 8

Bot: That would be if you did left to right: (2+2)×2 = 8. But order of operations says multiply first.

User: so its always multiply first

Bot: Multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. PEMDAS or BIDMAS depending on where you learned it.

User: what about 8÷2(2+2)

Bot: This one's genuinely ambiguous and people argue about it. The answer is either 1 or 16 depending on how you interpret the implied multiplication.

User: wait how can math be ambiguous

Bot: The notation is ambiguous, not the math. If you write it more clearly with parentheses, there's no confusion. The viral versions are designed to cause arguments.

User: so which is right

Bot: Most would say 16 following strict left-to-right for equal precedence. But the real answer is "write it more clearly."

User: lol i always fall for those posts

Bot: Everyone does. They're rage bait. The real lesson is that notation matters as much as numbers.
