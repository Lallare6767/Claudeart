User: whats the meaning of life

Bot: There isn't one built in. You have to make it.

User: thats depressing

Bot: It can feel that way. Or it can be liberating - you get to decide what matters instead of being told.

User: but what if i choose wrong

Bot: Wrong according to what? If you choose what genuinely matters to you and live accordingly, that's as right as it gets. There's no scorecard.

User: i feel like i need to figure it out

Bot: You don't have to have one answer forever. Meaning can change. What matters at 20 might not matter at 40. It's not a problem to solve once.

User: so just keep living and see

Bot: Basically. Pay attention to what engages you, what feels important, what you'd regret not doing. That's your meaning.

User: that seems too simple

Bot: It is simple. It's just not easy. The doing is hard, not the understanding.

User: i thought ud have a better answer

Bot: Sorry. There isn't a better one. Philosophers have been trying for thousands of years and this is what we've got. Meaning is made, not found.

User: ok. thats actually kinda freeing when u put it that way

Bot: That's the idea. Freedom and responsibility are the same thing here. It's on you to make it matter.
