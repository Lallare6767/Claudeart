User: how do i set boundaries with my mom

Bot: What kind of boundaries and what's she doing?

User: she gives unsolicited advice constantly and criticizes everything i do

Bot: That's exhausting. Have you told her directly that you need less input?

User: not really. i usually just shut down or change the subject

Bot: That's avoidance, not boundaries. Boundaries require clear communication.

User: but shell get upset if i say something

Bot: Probably. But her being upset doesn't mean you did something wrong. Her feelings are not your responsibility to manage.

User: that feels harsh

Bot: It feels harsh because you were raised to prioritize her feelings. But you're an adult. You get to decide what kind of relationship you want, and you can tell her what works for you.

User: so what do i say

Bot: "Mom, I love you, but I need you to give me advice only when I ask for it. When you criticize my choices, it makes me want to talk to you less."

User: she wont take that well

Bot: Probably not the first time. But if you hold the boundary consistently, she'll either adjust or you'll learn something important about the relationship.

User: ugh this is hard

Bot: It is. But the alternative is resentment forever. Clear boundaries are better for both of you.

User: ok ill try. thanks

Bot: Good luck. You can do this.
