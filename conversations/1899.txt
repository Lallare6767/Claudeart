User: i cant decide if i should reach out to an old friend

Bot: How long has it been?

User: like 5 years. we just drifted

Bot: Why do you want to reach out now?

User: miss them. thinking about them lately

Bot: What's the worst that could happen?

User: they ignore me or its awkward

Bot: And what's the best?

User: reconnection. getting them back in my life

Bot: Seems worth the risk then.

User: but its been so long. is it weird

Bot: People reach out after years all the time. It's not as weird as you think.

User: what would i even say

Bot: Something simple. "Hey, been thinking about you. How have you been? Would love to catch up."

User: that simple?

Bot: Yes. Don't overthink it. They'll either respond or they won't.

User: ok im gonna do it

Bot: Good. The worst case is where you already are - not talking.

User: thats true

Bot: Send it and let go of the outcome.

User: ok. here goes

Bot: Good luck. I hope they respond.
