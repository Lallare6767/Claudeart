User: give me a random fun fact

Bot: Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, and one pumps it to the rest of the body. The blood is blue because it uses copper-based hemocyanin instead of iron-based hemoglobin.

User: wait what why

Bot: Copper-based blood is actually more efficient at transporting oxygen in cold, low-oxygen environments like the deep ocean. Evolution optimized for their habitat, not for looking normal to us.

User: thats wild. another one

Bot: Honey never spoils. Archaeologists have found 3000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs that was still edible. The low moisture content and acidic pH create an environment where bacteria can't grow.

User: omg thats insane. one more

Bot: Bananas are berries but strawberries aren't. Botanically, a berry comes from a single ovary and has seeds embedded in the flesh. Bananas qualify, strawberries don't - their seeds are on the outside.

User: what!! my whole life is a lie

Bot: Botanical definitions are different from culinary ones. Just wait until you learn that peanuts aren't nuts.

User: WHAT

Bot: Legumes. They grow underground in pods like beans. Almonds and walnuts are also not technically nuts - they're drupes, like peaches.

User: im losing my mind

Bot: Welcome to botanical chaos. Anything else you want ruined?
