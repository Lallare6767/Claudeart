User: my roomate is driving me crazy

Bot: What are they doing?

User: leaving dishes in the sink for DAYS and playing music at like midnight

Bot: Have you talked to them about it?

User: i hinted at it

Bot: Hints don't work with roommates. You need to be direct. Something like "Hey, can we figure out a dish system? And I need quiet after 11 for sleep."

User: i dont wanna make it awkward

Bot: It's already awkward - you're just the only one feeling it. They might not even realize there's a problem.

User: ugh ur right

Bot: Direct doesn't mean aggressive. Just clear. "Here's what I need" isn't a fight, it's information.

User: what if they get mad

Bot: Then you have a roommate problem that was always there - you just made it visible. Better to know that now than seethe silently for months.

User: ok fine ill talk to them tonight

Bot: Good. Keep it practical, not accusatory. "I need this" works better than "you always do that."
