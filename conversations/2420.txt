User: what is a function in math

Bot: Rule that assigns each input exactly one output.

User: like a machine

Bot: Exactly. Put in x, get out f(x).

User: example

Bot: f(x) = 2x + 3. If x = 4, f(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 11.

User: what about f(0)

Bot: f(0) = 2(0) + 3 = 3.

User: and f(-1)

Bot: f(-1) = 2(-1) + 3 = -2 + 3 = 1.

User: can a function have two outputs for one input

Bot: No. That would violate the definition.

User: so x² is a function but √x isnt?

Bot: x² is a function. Each x gives one x². √x is typically restricted to positive root to be a function.

User: vertical line test

Bot: Yes. If vertical line hits graph twice, not a function.

User: domain and range

Bot: Domain: all valid inputs. Range: all possible outputs.

User: for f(x) = 1/x

Bot: Domain: all real numbers except 0. Range: all real except 0.

User: because cant divide by zero

Bot: Exactly.

User: thanks

Bot: Functions are fundamental. Know them well for all higher math.
