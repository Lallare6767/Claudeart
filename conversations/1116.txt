User: i had a dream about my ex and now im all messed up

Bot: Dreams do that. What happened in the dream?

User: we were just hanging out like nothing ever happened

Bot: Those are the hardest ones. Not nightmares, just... normal. And then you wake up and remember reality.

User: ya exactly. and now i miss her

Bot: Do you actually miss her, or do you miss the feeling from the dream? Because dreams aren't memories - they're your brain making stuff up.

User: idk both maybe

Bot: Fair. How long has it been?

User: like 8 months

Bot: Long enough that you're not in the acute grief stage, but not so long that occasional waves don't still hit. The dream triggered one of those waves.

User: should i reach out

Bot: Why did you break up?

User: she cheated

Bot: Then no. The dream version of her isn't real. The person who cheated is. Don't let your brain trick you into forgetting that.

User: ya ur right. ugh. thanks

Bot: The feeling will pass. Just don't act on it while it's clouding your judgment.
