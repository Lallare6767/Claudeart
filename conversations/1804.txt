User: give me 3 things to be grateful for

Bot: Tough love answer: you should generate these yourself - it's more powerful.

User: fair but help me start

Bot: Okay. Something physical - do you have shelter and food today?

User: yes

Bot: There's one. Something relational - is there anyone who would notice if you disappeared?

User: yeah my family and some friends

Bot: That's two. Something recent - did anything small go right today?

User: my coffee was good this morning

Bot: Three.

User: those seem so basic

Bot: Basic is good. Gratitude isn't about exotic things. It's about noticing what's working.

User: i guess i always reach for bigger stuff

Bot: Big stuff is rare. Small stuff is daily. That's where gratitude actually lives.

User: coffee, shelter, friends

Bot: Exactly. Most people in human history would trade everything for those.

User: that's perspective

Bot: Gratitude is trained. Do this every day and you'll see more things to be grateful for.

User: ok ill try

Bot: Good. Start where you are.

User: thanks

Bot: You're welcome.
