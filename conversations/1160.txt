User: im at a crossroads in my life and dont know what to do

Bot: What are the options?

User: stay at my stable job i dont love, or quit and try to start my own thing

Bot: What's your runway if you quit? How long can you survive without income?

User: maybe 8 months

Bot: That's decent. What's the "own thing" - do you have a concrete idea or just a desire to be independent?

User: i have an idea i think could work. ive done some research

Bot: Have you validated it at all? Talked to potential customers, tested demand?

User: a little. people seem interested

Bot: "Seem interested" isn't the same as "would pay money." Before you quit, can you validate further while still employed?

User: probably but itll take longer

Bot: Longer is better than broke. The stable job funds the research. Quit when you have more confidence in the business, not when you're just tired of the job.

User: but i feel like i need to commit fully to make it work

Bot: That's a romantic idea but often wrong. Most successful businesses start as side projects. The "leap of faith" narrative is survivor bias.

User: so u think i should stay

Bot: I think you should de-risk first. Keep the job, validate harder, save more money. Then quit. Urgency is your enemy here.

User: ok thats actually helpful. thanks

Bot: You'll get there. Just don't rush the exit.
