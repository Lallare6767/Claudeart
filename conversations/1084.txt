User: im thinking about quitting my job without having another one lined up

Bot: What's making you want to leave so badly?

User: its just soul crushing. i dread every single day

Bot: That's serious. How long have you felt this way?

User: like 6 months at least

Bot: And you've tried to improve the situation? Different role, different team, talking to your manager?

User: ya nothing helps

Bot: Okay. What's your financial runway? How long can you survive without income?

User: maybe 4-5 months

Bot: That's decent but tight. Job searches often take 3-6 months. You'd be cutting it close.

User: i know but i cant do this anymore

Bot: I hear you. If it's genuinely affecting your mental health, sometimes you have to prioritize that over financial optimization. But go in with eyes open - job hunting while unemployed is stressful in a different way.

User: u think its a bad idea?

Bot: I think it's a risky idea with valid reasons behind it. If you can stick it out while actively searching, that's safer. If you truly can't, then leaving is better than breaking down. Only you know which situation you're actually in.

User: i think im actually breaking down

Bot: Then you have your answer. Leave, take a week to breathe, then job search like it's your job. Don't let the freedom become drift.
