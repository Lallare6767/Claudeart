User: what should i cook for my parents visit

Bot: What do they like to eat?

User: pretty traditional. meat and potatoes type

Bot: How about a roast chicken with roasted vegetables? Classic and impressive.

User: i was thinking that but it feels too simple

Bot: Simple done well is more impressive than complicated done poorly.

User: true

Bot: Season the chicken well, roast at high heat for crispy skin. Root vegetables in the pan to catch drippings.

User: any specific recipe

Bot: Thomas Keller's roast chicken is famous for simplicity. Just salt, pepper, high heat. Perfect every time.

User: what about a side

Bot: Mashed potatoes seem on brand. Maybe a green salad to balance.
