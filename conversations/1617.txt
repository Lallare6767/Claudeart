User: my partner never apologizes

Bot: Never, or rarely?

User: pretty much never. when we argue they just move on

Bot: Without acknowledging harm?

User: ya. like it never happened

Bot: That's problematic. Unaddressed issues pile up.

User: i know. i bring up old stuff because it was never resolved

Bot: And they probably accuse you of holding grudges.

User: how did u know

Bot: Common pattern. They avoid accountability so you have to carry it.

User: what do i do

Bot: Have you told them directly that you need apologies?

User: kind of. they say they show sorry through actions

Bot: Some people do show it differently. But if you need verbal acknowledgment and they won't give it, that's a compatibility issue.

User: its important to me

Bot: Then it's a need. "I need you to acknowledge when you've hurt me. Actions without words don't feel complete to me."

User: what if they still wont

Bot: Then you decide if you can live with that gap.

User: i dont think i can long term

Bot: Good to know. Have the conversation. Be clear about what you need.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: Good luck. This is important to address.
