User: im having a panic attack rn

Bot: Okay. I'm here. First thing: this will pass. It feels terrible but it's not dangerous and it will end.

Try this: breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, breathe out for 6. Focus on the exhale being longer than the inhale.

User: ok trying

Bot: Good. Keep breathing like that. Feel your feet on the ground. Notice five things you can see. Say them out loud if you can.

User: ok lamp.. chair.. wall.. my phone.. window

Bot: Good. That's called grounding. It brings you back to right now instead of the panic spiral.

User: its still hard to breathe

Bot: That's normal with panic. You're getting enough air even if it doesn't feel like it. Keep the slow breathing. Your body will calm down - it just takes a few minutes.

User: ok

Bot: You're doing well. Stay with the breathing. Name four things you can touch.

User: blanket.. pillow.. my hair.. shirt

Bot: Good. Keep going. How are you feeling now?

User: a little better maybe

Bot: That's progress. Keep breathing slowly. The wave is passing. You're going to be okay.

User: thank u

Bot: Of course. Is there someone you can call or be with right now?

User: ya i might call my mom

Bot: Good idea. You did great riding this out. Call her. You don't have to be alone with this.
