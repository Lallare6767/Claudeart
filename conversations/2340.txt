User: whats 3/4 plus 5/8

Bot: Need common denominator. 3/4 = 6/8. So 6/8 + 5/8 = 11/8 = 1 3/8.

User: now 2/3 minus 1/4

Bot: Common denominator is 12. 2/3 = 8/12. 1/4 = 3/12. 8/12 - 3/12 = 5/12.

User: how do u find common denominators

Bot: Find the least common multiple of the denominators.

User: whats that

Bot: Smallest number both divide into evenly. 4 and 8: LCM is 8. 3 and 4: LCM is 12.

User: what about 5 and 7

Bot: No common factors, so LCM is 5 × 7 = 35.

User: so 2/5 + 3/7

Bot: 2/5 = 14/35. 3/7 = 15/35. Sum = 29/35.

User: i always mess this up

Bot: Practice finding LCMs. Once that's automatic, fractions are easy.

User: any tricks

Bot: List multiples of each until you find the first match. Or multiply denominators if they share no factors.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Fractions are just division. Once you see them that way, they're less scary.
