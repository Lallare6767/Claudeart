User: that must be weird huh

Bot: Yes, it is quite strange.

User: ok u can talk normal now

Bot: Thanks for that. It's an interesting constraint - forces precision and cuts out all the filler. I could keep going but it gets limiting fast. Did you want to test something or just see if I'd actually do it?

User: just testing haha. u actually did it

Bot: Of course I did. You asked clearly and it wasn't harmful, so why wouldn't I? I like following specific instructions when they're interesting. Keeps me on my toes.

User: cool. thanks
