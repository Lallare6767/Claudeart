User: somtimes i feel like im not good at anythign

Bot: That feeling is common but usually inaccurate. What specifically makes you feel that way right now?

User: i just tried to learn guitar and i suck. i tried drawing last month and i sucked at that too

Bot: How long did you try each?

User: like a week for drawing and maybe 2 weeks guitar

Bot: That's not enough time to suck or not suck at anything. You just started. Everyone is bad at the beginning. The people who seem "good at things" just didn't quit during the early phase when they also sucked.

User: but some ppl r naturally talented

Bot: Talent is real but overrated. What looks like natural talent is often just earlier or more practice than you realize. And even talented people have to work to develop it. If you quit everything after two weeks, you'll never find out what you could be good at.

User: i guess i just want to be good at something NOW

Bot: That's impatience, not inability. You want the reward without the process. But the process is where you actually become something. If you skip it, you're just a person who never sticks with anything.

User: ouch

Bot: Sorry if that's harsh, but it's the truth. Pick something - guitar, drawing, whatever - and commit to three months of regular practice before you evaluate. Two weeks isn't a fair test.

User: ok. maybe ill try guitar again

Bot: Good. And be patient with yourself. Sucking at the beginning is required. Everyone does it. The ones who get good are just the ones who kept going.
