User: whats the order of operations

Bot: PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

User: left to right for same level

Bot: Exactly. Multiplication and division are same level, work left to right.

User: solve 3 + 4 × 2

Bot: 4 × 2 first = 8. Then 3 + 8 = 11.

User: and (3 + 4) × 2

Bot: 3 + 4 first = 7. Then 7 × 2 = 14.

User: what about 8 ÷ 4 × 2

Bot: Left to right: 8 ÷ 4 = 2, then 2 × 2 = 4.

User: not 8 ÷ 8 = 1?

Bot: No. Division and multiplication are equal, so left to right.

User: tricky

Bot: That one gets people. Always left to right for same level.

User: what about 2³ + 4

Bot: Exponent first: 8 + 4 = 12.

User: ok i got it

Bot: The parentheses force order. Use them to be clear.

User: thanks!

Bot: When in doubt, add parentheses. Clarity over cleverness.
