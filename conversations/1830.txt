User: i feel like my life is on pause

Bot: What do you mean?

User: like im just waiting for something to start

Bot: Waiting for what?

User: i dont know. the right job. the right person. something

Bot: This is your life. There's no unpause button coming.

User: but it doesnt feel like real life yet

Bot: That's a dangerous mindset. You'll wait forever for something that isn't coming.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Start living as if this is your real life. Because it is.

User: but things arent how i want them

Bot: They never will be completely. That's not how it works.

User: so i just accept it?

Bot: No. Work toward what you want. But live fully while you do.

User: whats the difference

Bot: The difference is whether you're present now or just waiting for later.

User: i guess ive been waiting

Bot: Waiting is comfortable. It doesn't require action or risk.

User: ouch

Bot: What would you do differently if you accepted this is your life now?

User: id probably go after things more

Bot: Then go. The right time is never coming. There's only now.

User: ok. thanks for the wake up call

Bot: Go live your life. It's already happening.
