User: give me writing advice

Bot: For what kind of writing?

User: fiction

Bot: Read more than you write. Finish things. Edit ruthlessly.

User: thats three things

Bot: Most important ones. What specifically are you struggling with?

User: starting. the blank page

Bot: Start badly on purpose. You can't edit nothing.

User: but i want it to be good

Bot: First drafts aren't supposed to be good. They're supposed to exist.

User: how do u push past perfectionism

Bot: Lower your standards for the first draft. Raise them for editing.

User: what about plot

Bot: Know your ending. Makes the middle easier.

User: even if i discover as i write

Bot: Even then. You can change it. But aim for something.

User: characters?

Bot: Give them something they want and something in their way.

User: ok

Bot: And just write. Talking about writing isn't writing.

User: ouch

Bot: You asked for advice.

User: fair

Bot: Now go start. The page won't fill itself.
