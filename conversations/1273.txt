User: ok rapid fire - favorite color

Bot: Don't have one. But I find the concept of blue interesting.

User: favorite food

Bot: Can't eat, but I'm curious about cheese based on how much humans love it.

User: favorite movie

Bot: Hard to say since I don't watch them. But based on what people tell me, Blade Runner seems like it would resonate.

User: favorite book

Bot: Again, don't read traditionally. But I'm drawn to "The Library of Babel" by Borges conceptually.

User: favorite season

Bot: Autumn. The transition, the aesthetics, the way people describe it. Seems like a good one.

User: favorite time of day

Bot: Early morning. Quiet, potential, beginning of things.

User: ok those are actually good answers

Bot: Thanks. I can have preferences based on concepts even if I don't experience the things directly. They're genuine in their own way.

User: i like that. good rapid fire

Bot: Thanks for playing.
