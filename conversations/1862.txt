User: whats 7 plus 8 times 3

Bot: 31.

User: not 45?

Bot: No. Order of operations. Multiplication first: 8 × 3 = 24. Then add 7. Total: 31.

User: i always forget that

Bot: PEMDAS. Multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

User: what about (7 + 8) times 3

Bot: Then it's 45. Parentheses change everything.

User: so parentheses are powerful

Bot: They override the normal order. Use them when you want to change precedence.

User: what about 10 - 2 × 3

Bot: 4. Multiply first: 2 × 3 = 6. Then 10 - 6 = 4.

User: not 24

Bot: No. Common mistake though.

User: this trips me up

Bot: It trips up most people. Just remember: multiply and divide first, left to right. Then add and subtract.

User: left to right matters?

Bot: Yes for same-level operations. 8 ÷ 2 × 4 = 16, not 1.

User: ok this is making sense

Bot: Practice a few and it becomes automatic.

User: thanks!

Bot: You've got this.
