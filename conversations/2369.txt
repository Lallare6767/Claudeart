User: how do u solve for x in 3x + 7 = 22

Bot: Isolate x. First subtract 7 from both sides.

User: 3x = 15

Bot: Now divide both sides by 3.

User: x = 5

Bot: Correct. Check: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22. ✓

User: ok what about 2x - 4 = 10

Bot: You try.

User: add 4 to both sides. 2x = 14. divide by 2. x = 7

Bot: Perfect. Check it.

User: 2(7) - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10. yes!

Bot: Good habit. Always verify.

User: harder one

Bot: 5x + 3 = 2x + 18

User: um. variables on both sides

Bot: Get all x terms on one side.

User: subtract 2x from both. 3x + 3 = 18

Bot: Now?

User: subtract 3. 3x = 15. x = 5

Bot: Check?

User: 5(5) + 3 = 28. 2(5) + 18 = 28. yes!

Bot: Excellent. You've got linear equations down.

User: thanks!

Bot: Practice makes perfect. The steps become automatic.
