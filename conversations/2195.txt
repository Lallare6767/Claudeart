Bot: What do you have?

User: chicken rice vegetables

Bot: That's a complete meal. Any preferences?

User: easy

Bot: Sheet pan chicken. Chicken thighs, chopped vegetables, olive oil, salt. 400°F, 30 minutes.

User: thats it?

Bot: Season with whatever you have. Garlic powder, paprika, herbs.

User: and the rice

Bot: Make it while chicken roasts. Done at the same time.

User: ok i can do that

Bot: The trick with sheet pan is cut vegetables same size. Even cooking.

User: good tip

Bot: Broccoli and carrots work well. Bell peppers too.

User: i have zucchini

Bot: Perfect. It cooks fast so add it later or cut thick.

User: thats the best part

Bot: Enjoy your dinner!
