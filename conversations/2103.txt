User: solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0

Bot: Factor it: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0. So x = 2 or x = 3.

User: how did u factor that

Bot: Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. That's -2 and -3.

User: what about x² + x - 12

Bot: Numbers that multiply to -12 and add to 1. That's 4 and -3. (x + 4)(x - 3) = 0.

User: so x = -4 or x = 3

Bot: Perfect.

User: what if i cant factor

Bot: Use quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/2a.

User: what about x² - 2x - 8

Bot: Try factoring first.

User: multiply to -8 add to -2... -4 and 2?

Bot: Yes! (x - 4)(x + 2) = 0.

User: x = 4 or x = -2

Bot: You've got it.

User: these are satisfying

Bot: Factoring is pattern matching. Gets easier with practice.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep at it. Quadratics are foundational.
