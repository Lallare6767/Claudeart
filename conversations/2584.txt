User: how do i know if i need new tires

Bot: Check tread depth. Penny test works.

User: whats that

Bot: Put penny in tread, Lincoln's head down. If you see all of his head, tires are worn.

User: what if i see some of his head

Bot: Then you have some life left but monitor them.

User: anything else to check

Bot: Look for cracks, bulges, or uneven wear.

User: uneven wear means what

Bot: Could be alignment or suspension issues.

User: one tire looks more worn than others

Bot: Get alignment checked. That's not normal.

User: how often should i replace them

Bot: Usually every 50,000-70,000 miles depending on type.

User: i have no idea my mileage

Bot: Check your records or ask at an oil change place.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Don't drive on bald tires. It's dangerous, especially in rain.
