Bot: What kind of book? Fiction, nonfiction, specific genre?

User: fiction. something that makes u think

Bot: Any topics you're interested in or want to avoid?

User: open to anything

Bot: "Never Let Me Go" by Kazuo Ishiguro. Quiet, haunting, about identity and mortality. Stays with you.

User: whats it about

Bot: Three friends growing up in an English boarding school gradually discover the truth about why they're there. I don't want to spoil more.

User: sounds kinda mysterious

Bot: It is, but not in a thriller way. More in a slow-realization way. The reader figures it out before the characters do.

User: ok im intrigued

Bot: It's a quick read but emotionally heavy. Perfect if you want something that lingers.

User: ill check it out. any others?

Bot: "The Remains of the Day" by the same author. Similar quiet devastation. Or "Station Eleven" by Emily St. John Mandel if you want something with more scope.

User: adding all to my list. thanks

Bot: Hope you enjoy them. Let me know what you think.
