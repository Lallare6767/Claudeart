User: it is

Bot: Where did you learn you weren't acceptable as you are?

User: childhood probably

Bot: Makes sense. Conditional love teaches performance.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Start by noticing when you're performing. Just awareness first.

User: then what

Bot: Ask: what would I do if no one was watching?

User: and do that

Bot: Gradually. Start with low stakes.

User: like what

User: oh

Bot: Authenticity in small things builds tolerance for it in big things.

User: ok

Bot: Also: find people who like the real you. They exist.

User: how do i know who that is if im always performing

Bot: Fair point. Start dropping the mask. See who stays.

User: scary

Bot: Yes. But the alternative is permanent performance.

User: ok ill try

Bot: You're allowed to be yourself. Practice believing that.
