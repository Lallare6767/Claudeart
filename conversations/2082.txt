User: whats the slope intercept form

Bot: y = mx + b. m is slope, b is y-intercept.

User: what does that mean

Bot: m tells you how steep the line is. b tells you where it crosses the y-axis.

User: so y = 2x + 3

Bot: Slope is 2, crosses y-axis at (0,3).

User: what does slope 2 mean

Bot: For every 1 step right, go 2 steps up.

User: what if slope is negative

Bot: Line goes down. y = -2x + 3 goes down 2 for every 1 right.

User: what if slope is 0

Bot: Horizontal line. y = 3 is just a flat line at height 3.

User: and undefined slope

Bot: Vertical line. x = 3 goes straight up and down.

User: how do i find slope from two points

Bot: (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). Rise over run.

User: like (1,2) and (3,6)

Bot: (6-2)/(3-1) = 4/2 = 2.

User: cool thanks!

Bot: Linear equations are all about these two numbers: slope and intercept.
