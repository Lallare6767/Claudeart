User: my best friend moved away and im sad

Bot: How far away?

User: across the country. california to new york

Bot: That's a big distance. When did they leave?

User: two weeks ago. we talked every day for 10 years and now its different

Bot: Different how?

User: time zones are hard. our schedules dont overlap. texts feel shallow compared to hanging out

Bot: Long distance friendships require intentional effort. You have to schedule calls instead of just bumping into each other.

User: ya but it feels forced

Bot: At first it will. You're building new patterns. Give it a few months before judging.

User: what if we drift apart

Bot: Some friendships survive distance and some don't. But 10 years of closeness has momentum. It won't vanish overnight.

User: i hope not

Bot: Set a regular video call - even monthly gives you something to look forward to. And plan a visit.

User: thats a good idea

Bot: The friendship changes but it doesn't have to end. You both have to want to maintain it though.

User: i do

Bot: Then tell them. Make the effort visible.
