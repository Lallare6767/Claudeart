User: my parents want me to move back home and i dont want to

Bot: How old are you and what's their reason?

User: 26. they say it would save money

Bot: Would it?

User: yeah but id lose my independence

Bot: That's a real cost. What specifically would you lose?

User: my own space. not having to answer to anyone. privacy

Bot: Those matter. Have you explained that to them?

User: they dont understand. they think im wasting money

Bot: Can you afford your current situation?

User: barely. but im making it work

Bot: Then the question is: is independence worth the financial strain?

User: to me it is

Bot: That's your answer. You're an adult making an adult trade-off.

User: they make me feel guilty though

Bot: Guilt is their tool, not your problem. You can love them and still live separately.

User: how do i get them to accept it

Bot: You don't need their acceptance. Just their respect for your choice.

User: that feels harsh

Bot: It's not harsh to have boundaries. It's healthy.

User: ok. thanks

Bot: You're allowed to want your own life. That's what adulthood is.
