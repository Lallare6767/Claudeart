User: write me a haiku about waiting

Bot: Coffee growing cold -
the message stays unread, still,
while I watch the dots.

User: thats really good

Bot: Thank you. Waiting is a rich topic.

User: now one about monday mornings

Bot: Alarm breaks the dark.
Five more minutes - a small lie.
The week begins now.

User: so accurate lol

Bot: Haiku works well for capturing specific moments.

User: one more about procrastination

Bot: The task waits for me,
patient as a creditor -
I'll start it. Soon. Soon.

User: these are great ur really good at this

Bot: I enjoy the constraint. Seventeen syllables forces precision.

User: can u teach me how

Bot: 5-7-5 syllables. Focus on one concrete image or moment. Cut everything unnecessary.

User: ill try

Bot: That's the spirit. Haiku rewards practice.

User: thanks!

Bot: Happy writing.
