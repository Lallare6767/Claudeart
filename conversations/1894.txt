User: industry conference. dont know anyone

Bot: Ask about their work: "What brings you to this conference?" or "What's been the most interesting session so far?"

User: those are good

Bot: "How did you get into [industry]?" works well. People like telling their origin story.

User: what if i blank

Bot: Have three questions prepared in advance. Pull from them when needed.

User: what if they give short answers

Bot: Ask follow-ups. "Tell me more about that" or "How does that work?"

User: and if its awkward

Bot: It'll be awkward sometimes. That's okay. Move on politely.

User: what do i say to end a convo

Bot: "Well, I should go mingle, but nice talking with you!" Then actually move.

User: should i exchange contacts

Bot: If the conversation was good, yes. "I'd love to continue this - can I get your card?"

User: what if they seem uninterested

Bot: Let them go. Networking is numbers. Not everyone will be a connection.

User: this helps a lot

Bot: Preparation beats social anxiety. Go in with your questions ready.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck at the conference.
