User: why do i always fall for unavailable people

Bot: What kind of unavailable - emotionally, logistically, in a relationship?

User: emotionally mostly

Bot: Probably because emotional unavailability feels familiar. People often recreate relationship dynamics from childhood, even painful ones, because familiarity feels like home.

User: thats dark

Bot: It's not destiny though. Once you see the pattern, you can interrupt it. But it takes conscious effort.

User: how do i do that

Bot: First, recognize the signs early. If someone is inconsistent, withholding, or keeps you guessing - those are flags. The "challenge" feeling is actually a warning, not attraction.

User: but the chase is exciting

Bot: Yeah. And then you win and there's nothing there. The excitement is just anxiety dressed up as attraction. Stable isn't boring - it's just different.

User: how do i make stable feel exciting

Bot: You don't. You learn to appreciate that "boring" is actually peace. Excitement from unpredictability is a symptom, not a feature.

User: i have a lot to unpack i think

Bot: Probably. A therapist can help you trace where this comes from and rewire it. It's common but it's not fixed.

User: ok thanks for the insight

Bot: Good luck. You can break the pattern, it just takes awareness and work.
