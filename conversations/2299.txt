User: wat is a ratio

Bot: Comparison of two quantities. 3:2 means 3 of one thing for every 2 of another.

User: how is it different from fraction

Bot: Ratios compare. Fractions represent parts of a whole.

User: can u convert between them

Bot: Yes. 3:2 can be written as 3/5 and 2/5 of a whole.

User: oh because 3+2=5

Bot: Exactly. The parts add up to the total.

User: give me an example

Bot: Recipe uses flour and sugar in 3:2 ratio. 15 cups total. How much of each?

User: um. 3+2=5. 15/5=3. so 3×3=9 flour and 3×2=6 sugar?

Bot: Perfect. That's ratio thinking.

User: what about 5:3 ratio with 24 total

Bot: You try.

User: 5+3=8. 24/8=3. so 15 and 9?

Bot: Correct.

User: this is easier than i thought

Bot: Ratios show up everywhere. Cooking, mixing, scaling.

User: and in math class

Bot: Yes, but real life too. Master them and they're very useful.

User: thanks!

Bot: Good work. You've got ratio thinking down.
