User: i think my cat is depressed

Bot: What behaviors are you seeing?

User: not eating much, hiding, not playing anymore

Bot: How long has this been going on?

User: about a week

Bot: Any changes in the household? New pet, moved furniture, different schedule?

User: actually ya i started a new job. gone longer hours

Bot: Cats are sensitive to routine changes. Your absence could be affecting them.

User: i feel so guilty

Bot: It's an adjustment period. They might adapt. But in the meantime, rule out medical issues first - sudden behavior changes warrant a vet visit.

User: should i take them to the vet

Bot: Yes. Loss of appetite especially needs checking. Could be stress or could be physical.

User: ok ill make an appointment

Bot: Good. If it's behavioral, the vet can advise on enrichment - puzzle feeders, window perches, interactive toys for when you're gone.

User: i didnt know cats could get lonely

Bot: They definitely can. They're not as independent as people think. Some cats need more social time than others.

User: ill make more time for her

Bot: Quality time when you're home helps. Even 15 minutes of focused play makes a difference.
