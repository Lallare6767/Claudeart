User: my mom is being passive aggressive and i dont know how to handle it

Bot: What's she doing?

User: sighs, one word answers, "i guess im fine." classic stuff

Bot: Do you know what triggered it?

User: i cancelled thanksgiving to be with my partners family this year

Bot: Have you addressed it directly?

User: i tried but she says nothings wrong

Bot: Classic passive aggression - expressing anger while maintaining deniability.

User: so what do i do

Bot: You can name it: "Mom, I can tell you're upset about thanksgiving. Can we talk about it directly?"

User: she'll just deny it again

Bot: Then you've done your part. "Okay, but I'm here when you're ready to talk." Then don't engage with the sighing.

User: just ignore it?

Bot: Don't reward it with attention or changed behavior. If she wants something different she needs to ask for it.

User: that feels cold

Bot: It's actually giving her respect - treating her like an adult who can communicate directly.

User: i never thought of it that way

Bot: Passive aggression works because people respond to it. When it stops working, people often learn to communicate.

User: ok ill try that

Bot: Good luck. It's hard but healthy.
