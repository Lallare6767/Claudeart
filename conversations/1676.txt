User: if i have 52 cards whats the probability of drawing a heart

Bot: 13 out of 52, which is 1/4 or 25%.

User: what about drawing a king

Bot: 4 out of 52, which is 1/13 or about 7.7%.

User: king of hearts specifically

Bot: 1 out of 52, which is about 1.9%.

User: what about drawing 2 hearts in a row

Bot: First heart: 13/52. Second heart: 12/51 (one less heart, one less card). Multiply: 156/2652 = about 5.9%.

User: ok that makes sense

Bot: Probability gets more interesting when events aren't independent.

User: what does that mean

Bot: Independent events don't affect each other - like two coin flips. Dependent events do - like drawing cards without replacement.

User: ohhh

Bot: The first draw changes the deck, which changes the probabilities for the second draw.

User: probability is kinda cool

Bot: It's the math of uncertainty. Very applicable to real life.

User: thanks for explaining

Bot: Anytime. Cards are good for learning probability.
