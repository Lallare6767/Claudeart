User: how do i calculate compound interest

Bot: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). P is principal, r is annual rate, n is compounds per year, t is time in years.

User: can u use real numbers

Bot: Sure. $1000 at 5% annual interest compounded monthly for 3 years.

User: ok

Bot: A = 1000(1 + 0.05/12)^(12×3) = 1000(1.00417)^36 ≈ $1161.47.

User: so i gain $161

Bot: Yes, compared to $150 with simple interest. The extra $11 is interest on interest.

User: why does compounding matter

Bot: Because the interest earns interest. More compounding periods = more growth.

User: whats the difference between monthly and daily

Bot: Small for short periods. Over 30 years, it adds up.

User: this is actually useful to know

Bot: Very useful. Understanding compound interest changes how you think about saving and debt.

User: debt compounds too?

Bot: Yes. That's why credit card debt grows so fast - high interest compounding daily.

User: oh no

Bot: Exactly. Compound interest is your friend when saving, your enemy when borrowing.

User: thanks for explaining

Bot: Financial literacy matters. You're asking the right questions.
