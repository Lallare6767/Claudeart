User: im procrastinating on something important

Bot: What is it and when is it due?

User: big work presentation. due friday

Bot: Today is what day?

User: wednesday

Bot: Okay, you have time but not much. What part are you procrastinating on?

User: all of it. i havent started

Bot: Why? Overwhelmed, scared it won't be good, or just avoiding?

User: probably scared it wont be good

Bot: Perfect is the enemy of done. A finished presentation that's 80% good beats a perfect one that doesn't exist.

User: ya i know but i freeze

Bot: Break it into smallest pieces. First: make a title slide. That's it. Then move to the next thing.

User: that seems too small

Bot: That's the point. Starting is the hard part. Once you're moving, momentum carries you.

User: ok ill make the title slide now

Bot: Good. Then the next piece. Don't think about the whole thing - just the next piece.

User: ok im doing it

Bot: Good luck. You've got this. Imperfect and done beats perfect and imaginary.
