User: whats 2 to the power of 10

Bot: 1024.

User: is that why computers use it

Bot: Exactly. Computers use binary (base 2), so powers of 2 are fundamental.

User: what about 2 to the 8

Bot: 256. That's why a byte has 256 possible values (0-255).

User: ohhh

Bot: And 2^16 is 65,536 - early computing limit for many things.

User: this is actually interesting

Bot: It's cool how computer constraints came from mathematical properties.

User: whats 2 to the 20

Bot: 1,048,576. That's where "megabyte" comes from - roughly a million bytes.

User: i always wondered why it wasnt exactly a million

Bot: Because it's 2^20, not 10^6. They're close but not the same.

User: makes sense now

Bot: The binary world and decimal world don't align perfectly.

User: thanks for the lesson

Bot: Computer history through math. My favorite kind of trivia.
