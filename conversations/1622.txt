User: why is everything so expensive now

Bot: Inflation plus supply chain disruptions from the pandemic plus increased wages in some sectors.

User: will it go back down

Bot: Some things will stabilize but prices rarely actually drop. They just stop rising as fast.

User: so im just poorer now

Bot: Your buying power decreased unless your wages kept up. For most people they haven't.

User: mine definitely havent

Bot: That's the squeeze most people feel. Costs up, income flat.

User: what can i do about it

Bot: Short term: budget tighter, look for deals, cut non-essentials. Medium term: negotiate raise or find higher paying job.

User: ive been thinking about looking elsewhere

Bot: Switching jobs is often the fastest way to increase income. Internal raises don't keep up with market rates.

User: why is that

Bot: Companies budget small increases for retention but budget bigger numbers for new hires. Doesn't make sense but it's standard.

User: thats so frustrating

Bot: It is. But you can use it - take your skills elsewhere for better pay.

User: ok maybe ill start looking

Bot: Even if you don't leave, knowing your market value is useful information.

User: true. thanks

Bot: Good luck out there.
