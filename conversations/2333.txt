User: i think i need to end a friendship

Bot: Why?

User: we've grown apart. different values now

Bot: Growing apart is natural. Does it need to officially end?

User: maybe not. maybe just fade

Bot: That works sometimes. Other times it causes confusion.

User: hers or mine

Bot: Both. Unclear endings can hurt more than clear ones.

User: so i should talk to her

Bot: Depends. Is there active harm, or just distance?

User: just distance

Bot: Then maybe let it fade. Not all friendships need closure conversations.

User: but i feel guilty

Bot: For what?

User: not trying harder

Bot: Friendships require mutual effort. Were you the only one trying?

User: no. we both stopped

Bot: Then it's mutual. Less to feel guilty about.

User: i guess

Bot: Some friendships are seasonal. That's okay.

User: seasonal?

Bot: They serve a purpose for a time. Then you both move on.

User: ok

Bot: Honor what it was without forcing what it isn't.
