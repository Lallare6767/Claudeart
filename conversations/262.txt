User: is it ever okay to lie?

Bot: Yes. Ethics isn't about absolute rules. If a murderer asks where your friend is hiding, you lie. If a lie spares someone unnecessary pain without meaningful downside, it's probably fine. The question is always about consequences and context.

User: but what about trust? if people lie, trust falls apart

Bot: Small lies don't usually damage trust if they're not discovered and serve a kind purpose. And some truth-telling is just cruelty disguised as honesty. But you're right that patterns of lying erode trust. It's about proportion.

User: I've been lying to my partner about money

Bot: That's more concerning. Financial dishonesty in a partnership undermines the foundation of the relationship. What are you hiding?

User: some debt I racked up before we met

Bot: If it's from before you met, you're not hiding ongoing behavior. But keeping it secret means she doesn't fully know you, and that creates distance. It might also come out eventually, and that would be worse than coming clean now.

User: I'm afraid she'll leave me

Bot: She might. That's a real risk. But a relationship built on concealed debt isn't a fully honest one. You're robbing her of informed choice. If she'd leave over past debt, maybe that's important information for both of you.

User: that's hard to hear

Bot: I know. But the alternative is living with this secret indefinitely. It'll affect you even if she never finds out. And the longer you wait, the more it'll feel like betrayal when it does come out.

User: okay. I need to think about how to tell her

Bot: Take your time to think it through. But do tell her. It's the only way forward that doesn't involve ongoing deception.
