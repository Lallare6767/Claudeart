User: i keep dating the same type of person and it keeps ending badly

Bot: What type?

User: charming at first but then controlling

Bot: That's a pattern worth examining. What draws you to them initially?

User: they seem confident and exciting

Bot: Confidence can mask control. The excitement might actually be intensity - which feels like attraction but is actually a warning sign.

User: how do i tell the difference

Bot: Confident people don't need to control you. They have their own lives and let you have yours. Controlling people create urgency, isolation, and make you feel off-balance.

User: ya that describes it

Bot: The attraction to that pattern might be about what felt normal growing up. Did you have controlling dynamics in your family?

User: my dad was pretty controlling actually

Bot: That makes sense. You're drawn to familiar dynamics even when they're harmful. It feels like home even when home wasn't safe.

User: so how do i break the pattern

Bot: Go slow. Watch for red flags early. If someone feels intensely exciting right away, that might be the warning, not the draw.

User: this is a lot to think about

Bot: It is. A therapist can help you work through the family stuff and recognize patterns earlier. This isn't something you have to figure out alone.

User: ya maybe i should talk to someone

Bot: I think it would help. The pattern won't change until you understand it.
