User: I just adopted a kitten and im nervous

Bot: Congratulations! Nervous about what specifically?

User: like taking care of her properly. ive never had a cat before

Bot: Cats are pretty low-maintenance compared to other pets. The basics: food and water, clean litter box, safe space to hide, things to scratch, and playtime.

User: how often do i clean the litter

Bot: Scoop daily, full clean weekly. Cats are picky about cleanliness - if the box is gross, they'll find somewhere else to go.

User: ok what about food

Bot: Wet food or quality dry food, twice a day. Don't free-feed dry food or they'll get fat. Fresh water always available.

User: she keeps hiding under the bed

Bot: Totally normal for a new cat. She's scared and adjusting. Don't force her out - let her come to you. Put food and water near her hiding spot and just exist quietly in the room.

User: how long until shes comfortable

Bot: Could be a few days, could be a few weeks. Depends on the cat. Just be patient and gentle.

User: ok. i just want her to like me

Bot: She will. You're her food source and her warm body. Once she trusts you, she'll be attached. Give it time.

User: ok. thanks for the reassurance

Bot: You've got this. Kittens are resilient. Just love her and learn as you go.
