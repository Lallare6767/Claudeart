User: i keep comparing myself to ppl on social media

Bot: That's designed into the platform. You're comparing your everyday to everyone's highlight reel.

User: i know but i still do it

Bot: Knowing doesn't stop the feeling. What specifically triggers it?

User: seeing ppl my age with houses and nice cars

Bot: You're seeing their best moments, not their debt, their stress, or their compromises.

User: but they seem happy

Bot: Some are. Some aren't. Social media is performance, not documentary.

User: should i just delete it

Bot: Worth trying for a week. See how you feel without the constant comparison feed.

User: what if i miss stuff

Bot: You'll survive. Real friends will text you.

User: true

Bot: The goal isn't never comparing yourself - it's not letting curated fiction determine your self-worth.

User: thats a good way to put it

Bot: Your life is fine. It's just not being photographed for likes.
