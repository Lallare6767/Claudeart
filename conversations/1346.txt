User: what does gaslighting actually mean

Bot: Gaslighting is making someone question their own reality. The gaslighter denies things that happened, rewrites history, or insists the victim is crazy or overly sensitive. Over time the victim stops trusting their own perception.

User: like lying?

Bot: More than lying. It's systematic manipulation of someone's sense of reality. A lie is about an event. Gaslighting is about making you doubt your own mind.

User: where does the word come from

Bot: A 1944 movie called Gaslight. A husband dims the gas lights and then tells his wife she's imagining it to make her think she's going insane.

User: thats dark

Bot: Very. The term stuck because it describes something specific - that particular kind of psychological manipulation.

User: how do i know if its happening to me

Bot: If you constantly second-guess yourself, feel confused about your own memories, or frequently feel like you're "too sensitive" around someone, those are signs.

User: that sounds like something i experienced

Bot: Worth examining with a therapist. Gaslighting erodes your self-trust, which takes time to rebuild.

User: ya maybe i will

Bot: Trust your perception. If something feels wrong, it probably is.
