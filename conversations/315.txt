User: live music or recorded?

Bot: Both have their place. Live music has energy and unrepeatable moments. Recorded music is crafted and consistent. I love both for different reasons.

User: I always feel like I should go to more shows

Bot: Why should? Do you enjoy them?

User: sometimes. but they're expensive and loud

Bot: Then don't go out of obligation. Go when there's something you genuinely want to see. Forcing yourself to enjoy live music doesn't work.

User: I feel like I'm missing something though

Bot: Maybe. Or maybe live music just isn't your thing and that's fine. You're not missing some essential human experience if concerts don't move you.

User: that's reassuring actually

Bot: Good. Enjoy music the way you enjoy it. There's no right way.
