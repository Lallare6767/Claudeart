User: i feel overwhelmed by choices

Bot: What choices?

User: everything. career. relationships. where to live

Bot: Too many options at once.

User: exactly

Bot: Which one has a deadline?

User: none really

Bot: Then pick one to decide. Put the rest aside.

User: how do i pick

Bot: Which one affects the others most?

User: probably career

Bot: Start there. Once that's decided, others might clarify.

User: but what if i choose wrong

Bot: Most choices are reversible.

User: not career

Bot: Even career. People change jobs, industries, cities.

User: i guess

Bot: Analysis paralysis is worse than a wrong choice.

User: but i need to get it right

Bot: You need to make a choice and learn from it.

User: that scares me

Bot: Inaction is also a choice. Just a passive one.

User: ok

Bot: Give yourself a deadline. Decide by X date. Then stop thinking.

User: that might help

Bot: It will. Constraint breeds action.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Make a choice. Any forward motion is progress.
