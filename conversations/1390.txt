User: ok u have 3 guesses. what animal am i thinking of

Bot: Is it a mammal?

User: ya

Bot: Is it bigger than a dog?

User: no

Bot: A cat.

User: wow first try basically. how

Bot: Most common small mammal people think of when playing guessing games. If you'd said it was bigger than a dog, I would have guessed elephant.

User: ok try again i got a harder one

Bot: Is it a mammal?

User: no

Bot: Does it live in water?

User: some of the time

Bot: A frog.

User: omg how

Bot: "Some of the time" in water + not a mammal. Amphibians are the classic answer. Turtles would be my second guess.

User: ok last one and its impossible

Bot: Is it real?

User: ya

Bot: Does it have legs?

User: no

Bot: A snake.

User: WHAT. ok im done u win

Bot: These games are fun. Try again with a mythical creature next time - those are trickier.
