User: help me word a difficult text to my roommate

Bot: What's the situation?

User: they keep leaving dishes in the sink and its been bothering me for months

Bot: Have you mentioned it before?

User: once casually. didnt change anything

Bot: Then this needs to be clearer. Do you want it friendly or firm?

User: friendly but clear

Bot: Something like: "Hey, I need to talk about the dishes. When they sit in the sink, it makes the kitchen unusable for me. Can we figure out a system?"

User: thats direct

Bot: Direct is better than passive aggressive. You've tried casual and it didn't work.

User: what if they get defensive

Bot: They might. But you're asking for basic consideration. You're allowed to.

User: what about "this might be silly but..."

Bot: Don't minimize it. Your needs aren't silly.

User: ok ur right

Bot: State the problem, the impact on you, and ask for collaboration.

User: collaboration?

Bot: "Can we figure out a system" is collaborative. Vs "you need to stop doing this."

User: oh that makes sense

Bot: Send it now while you're thinking about it.

User: ok here goes

Bot: Good luck. Roommate conflicts are easier to fix early than late.
