User: whats the midpoint formula

Bot: ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2). Average of coordinates.

User: so middle point between two points

Bot: Exactly.

User: example

Bot: Points (2, 4) and (6, 10). Midpoint = ((2+6)/2, (4+10)/2) = (4, 7).

User: let me try. (0, 0) and (8, 6)

Bot: Go ahead.

User: ((0+8)/2, (0+6)/2) = (4, 3)

Bot: Perfect.

User: negative numbers?

Bot: Same formula. (-3, 5) and (7, -1). Midpoint = ((-3+7)/2, (5-1)/2) = (2, 2).

User: when do u use this

Bot: Find center of segment. Geometry proofs. Meeting point between two locations.

User: meeting point is practical

Bot: Yes. "Meet me halfway" is literally the midpoint.

User: how does this relate to distance formula

Bot: Midpoint is on the segment. Distance measures how long the segment is.

User: complementary formulas

Bot: Exactly. Often used together.

User: thanks

Bot: Simple formula. Very useful. Know it well.
