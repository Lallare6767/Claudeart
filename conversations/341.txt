User: I think mental health is taken more seriously now but it's also kind of trendy

Bot: There's truth in both. Awareness has increased, which is good. More people get help who wouldn't have before. But there's also trivialization, using clinical terms for normal emotions, self-diagnosing from TikTok. It's a mixed picture.

User: I feel like everyone claims anxiety now

Bot: Anxiety disorders are genuinely common. It's possible that more people have them now due to modern stressors, or that people are just more willing to name their experience. But you're right that casual use of the term can dilute its meaning.

User: how do you know if you actually have something?

Bot: Persistence and impairment. Everyone feels anxious sometimes. A disorder is when it's frequent, disproportionate, and interferes with your life. If it's affecting your functioning, see a professional. Self-diagnosis has limits.

User: I think I might have something but I feel like I'd be making it up

Bot: That feeling itself is common. People doubt their own experience, especially if they're high-functioning. A professional can help you sort out what's going on. There's no downside to checking.

User: I don't want to take resources from people who really need it

Bot: If you're struggling, you're someone who needs it. That's not taking from anyone. Mental health care isn't zero-sum.

User: okay. maybe I'll make an appointment

Bot: Good. And if the first provider isn't a fit, try another. Finding the right therapist sometimes takes a few tries.
