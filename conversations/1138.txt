User: should i go to my high school reunion

Bot: When is it and how do you feel about high school?

User: next month. high school was whatever, not great not terrible

Bot: Are there specific people you want to see?

User: kinda curious about some people but not like desperately

Bot: Here's my take: reunions are usually underwhelming. The people you really want to stay connected to, you already did. The ones you didn't, there's usually a reason. But they can be fun for pure curiosity.

User: so u think i should skip it

Bot: I think you should go if you're genuinely curious and have realistic expectations. Skip if you're only going out of obligation or hoping for some movie-moment redemption arc.

User: lol no redemption arc needed

Bot: Then go. Have a drink, satisfy your curiosity about who got fat and who peaked early, leave after two hours.

User: haha ok that sounds about right

Bot: Set a time limit and treat it like anthropological research. It's more fun that way.

User: ok ill go for like 2 hours max

Bot: Perfect. Low commitment, mild entertainment, and then you never have to wonder.
