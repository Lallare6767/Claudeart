User: whats the quadratic formula

Bot: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

User: can u use it on x² + 5x + 6 = 0

Bot: Sure. a=1, b=5, c=6. x = (-5 ± √(25-24)) / 2 = (-5 ± 1) / 2.

User: so

Bot: x = (-5+1)/2 = -2 or x = (-5-1)/2 = -3.

User: cool. what about x² - 4x + 3 = 0

Bot: a=1, b=-4, c=3. x = (4 ± √(16-12)) / 2 = (4 ± 2) / 2.

User: so 3 or 1?

Bot: Yes! x = 3 or x = 1.

User: when do u use it vs factoring

Bot: Quadratic formula always works. Factoring is faster when it's obvious.

User: so formula is the backup

Bot: More like the universal tool. Factoring is the shortcut for nice numbers.

User: what if the stuff under the root is negative

Bot: No real solutions. The parabola doesn't cross the x-axis.

User: oh like that imaginary number thing

Bot: Exactly. Negative discriminant means complex roots.

User: thanks for the refresher

Bot: Quadratic formula is worth memorizing. You'll use it forever.
