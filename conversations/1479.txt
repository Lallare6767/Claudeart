Bot: What promise?

User: to stop drinking on weekdays. made it 3 days and then caved

Bot: Three days is progress though. How long were you managing before?

User: i wasnt. this was the first real attempt

Bot: Then three days is your baseline. Next time aim for four.

User: i feel like a failure

Bot: Progress isn't linear. Habits take multiple attempts to stick. The fact that you're trying matters.

User: i keep telling myself that

Bot: What triggered the cave?

User: stress from work. i came home and just wanted to not think

Bot: So you need another way to handle that stress. What else could you do?

User: exercise maybe. or i dont know

Bot: Try having a specific alternative ready before the stressor hits. "When I get home stressed, I will do X instead of drinking."

User: ok. ill try again

Bot: Start today. Three days is your floor. Beat it.

User: thanks for not judging me

Bot: No judgment. Changing habits is hard. Keep trying.
