User: i keep procrastinating and i hate myself for it

Bot: What are you procrastinating on?

User: everything. work, cleaning, calling ppl back

Bot: That's not laziness - that sounds like executive dysfunction. Maybe stress, maybe depression, maybe just being overwhelmed.

User: how do i fix it

Bot: Stop trying to do everything. Pick one small thing and do only that. Not "clean the house" - "put away five things." Not "do all my work" - "open the document."

User: that feels like cheating

Bot: It's not. It's working with your brain instead of against it. Starting is the hardest part. Once you start, momentum often carries you further.

User: but then i still have all this stuff to do

Bot: You'll still have all that stuff if you do nothing. At least this way you're making progress. Small progress beats no progress.

User: i guess ur right

Bot: Also: be kinder to yourself about it. Hating yourself for procrastinating doesn't make you more productive - it just makes you feel worse.

User: ok. im gonna go put away five things

Bot: Good. That's a start. And it counts.
