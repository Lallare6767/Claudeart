Bot: What makes you think that?

User: they hung out without inviting me. twice now

Bot: Were you usually invited before?

User: always

Bot: Have you asked about it?

User: no too embarrassed

Bot: Embarrassed why?

User: what if i imagined it. or they dont like me anymore

Bot: Either way you need to know.

User: how do i ask

Bot: Light tone. "Saw you all hung out - I would have come! Did I miss the invite?"

User: gives them an out

Bot: Yes. If it was oversight, easy fix. If not, you'll sense it.

User: what if they're phasing me out

Bot: Then you know and can act accordingly.

User: that would hurt

Bot: Yes. But not knowing is worse.

User: i guess

Bot: Real friends include you. If they don't, they're not your people.

User: ok ill ask

Bot: You deserve clarity. Get it.

User: thanks

Bot: Good luck. Hope it's just miscommunication.
