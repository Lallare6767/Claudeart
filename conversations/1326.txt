User: what makes someone mature

Bot: A few things: taking responsibility for their actions, regulating their emotions instead of acting on them, considering others' perspectives, and being comfortable with uncertainty.

User: what about age

Bot: Age doesn't guarantee maturity. Some 50-year-olds are immature. Some 25-year-olds are very mature. It correlates loosely but it's not the cause.

User: how do i become more mature

Bot: Notice when you're being reactive instead of thoughtful. Pause before acting on emotion. Take ownership of mistakes without excuses. Practice seeing things from other people's sides.

User: i think i'm reactive

Bot: Most young people are. It's a skill to learn, not a trait you either have or don't. You can develop it.

User: what about handling uncertainty

Bot: That means not needing to control everything, being okay with "I don't know," and making decisions despite incomplete information. Basically accepting that life is uncertain and proceeding anyway.

User: thats hard

Bot: Very. But mature people aren't paralyzed by uncertainty - they acknowledge it and move forward anyway.

User: ok this is helpful

Bot: Maturity is mostly just practice. Every time you choose thoughtful over reactive, you're building the muscle.
