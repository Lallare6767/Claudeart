User: explain ratio and proportion

Bot: Ratio compares two quantities. Proportion says two ratios are equal.

User: example

Bot: Ratio: 3 apples to 4 oranges = 3:4. Proportion: 3:4 = 6:8.

User: so proportion is an equation

Bot: Yes. Two equivalent ratios.

User: how do u solve proportions

Bot: Cross multiply. If a/b = c/d, then ad = bc.

User: solve 2/3 = x/12

Bot: 2 × 12 = 3x. 24 = 3x. x = 8.

User: and 5/x = 15/9

Bot: 5 × 9 = 15x. 45 = 15x. x = 3.

User: when do u use these

Bot: Recipes, maps, scale drawings, unit rates.

User: like if a recipe doubles

Bot: Yes. 2 cups flour for 4 servings. For 10 servings: 2/4 = x/10.

User: x = 5 cups

Bot: Perfect.

User: this is practical

Bot: Proportions solve a lot of real-world problems.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep practicing. The setup is the hard part.
