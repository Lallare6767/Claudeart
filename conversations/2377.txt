User: explain exponents

Bot: Repeated multiplication. 2³ means 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.

User: what about 2^0

Bot: Any number to the zero power is 1.

User: why

Bot: Pattern: 2⁴ = 16, 2³ = 8, 2² = 4, 2¹ = 2. Each step divides by 2. Next is 2⁰ = 1.

User: oh following the pattern

Bot: Exactly. Math stays consistent.

User: what about negative exponents

Bot: Flip it. 2^-3 = 1/2³ = 1/8.

User: so reciprocal

Bot: Yes. Negative exponent means divide instead of multiply.

User: what about fractions

Bot: 2^(1/2) = √2. Square root.

User: whoa

Bot: 2^(1/3) = cube root. Fraction exponents are roots.

User: so 8^(1/3) = 2

Bot: Because 2³ = 8. Yes.

User: this is making sense

Bot: Exponents are powerful. They compress big operations.

User: like 10^6 is a million

Bot: Right. Easy way to write big numbers.

User: thanks

Bot: Practice the rules. They show up everywhere.
