User: if i flip a coin 5 times whats the chance of getting all heads

Bot: (1/2)^5 = 1/32 ≈ 3.1%

User: what about at least 4 heads

Bot: 4 heads or 5 heads.

5 heads: 1 way
4 heads: 5 ways (HHHHT, HHHTH, HHTHH, HTHHH, THHHH)

Total: 6/32 = 3/16 ≈ 18.75%

User: how do u calculate the 5 ways

Bot: Combinations: C(5,4) = 5. There are 5 ways to choose which one of the 5 flips is tails.

User: what about exactly 3 heads

Bot: C(5,3) = 10 ways.
Probability: 10/32 = 5/16 ≈ 31.25%

User: why is 3 more likely than 4 or 5

Bot: More ways for it to happen. The middle outcomes have more combinations. That's why the distribution is bell-shaped.

User: oh like a normal distribution

Bot: Exactly. Binomial distribution approximates normal as the number of trials increases.

User: ok this makes more sense now

Bot: Probability is just counting outcomes. The formulas just make the counting faster.
