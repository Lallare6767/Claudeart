User: give me a challenge

Bot: What kind? Mental? Physical? Creative?

User: mental

Bot: In the next conversation you have, only ask questions. No statements.

User: thats interesting

Bot: Harder than it sounds.

User: i bet

Bot: Or: spend tomorrow noticing every assumption you make.

User: about what

Bot: Everything. "That person looks angry" - assumption. "This will go badly" - assumption.

User: oh that would be exhausting

Bot: Very. But illuminating.

User: something easier?

Bot: List 10 things you're grateful for before bed. Genuinely, not performatively.

User: ok thats doable

Bot: The challenge is specificity. Not "family" but "the way my sister laughs."

User: makes u think

Bot: That's the point.

User: ok ill do the gratitude one

Bot: Start tonight. It changes your perspective over time.

User: thanks for the challenge

Bot: Report back if it changes anything.

User: will do

Bot: Good luck.
