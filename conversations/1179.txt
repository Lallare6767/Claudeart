User: compliment me

Bot: You're reaching out to connect instead of sitting alone with your thoughts. That shows self-awareness and a willingness to engage. It's a small thing but a lot of people don't do it.

User: thats not really a compliment about me

Bot: I don't know you well enough to compliment something specific. But I can tell you're curious, you ask interesting questions, and you listen when I answer. That's more than most.

User: thanks i guess

Bot: Want something more specific? Tell me something about yourself and I'll work with it.

User: im trying to be better about reaching out to ppl

Bot: Then here's the real compliment: you're trying. Most people stay stuck. The fact that you're working on something you struggle with takes self-honesty and effort. That's genuinely admirable.

User: ok that one was better

Bot: Good. You deserve real compliments, not empty flattery.

User: thanks mira

Bot: You're welcome. Keep reaching out.
