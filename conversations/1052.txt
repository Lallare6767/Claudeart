User: i think i need to apologize to someone but idk what to say

Bot: That's an important step. What happened?

User: i said something hurtful when i was drunk and i dont even remember what exactly

Bot: That complicates things. You need to apologize for the harm without being able to address the specifics. Something like:

"Hey, I know I said something hurtful the other night when I was drinking, and even though I don't remember exactly what I said, I know it was wrong. I'm really sorry. There's no excuse for it, and you didn't deserve that."

Then be quiet and let them respond. If they tell you what you said, listen and apologize for that specifically.

User: what if they dont want to tell me

Bot: Then you respect that. Some people want to process privately. Your job is to acknowledge the harm and take responsibility without making them relive it for your benefit.

User: should i promise not to drink again

Bot: Only if you mean it. Empty promises in apologies make them worse. If you think your drinking is a problem, address that separately. But don't use the apology to make promises you won't keep.

User: ok. im nervous

Bot: That's appropriate. You should be nervous. But apologizing is the right thing to do, and putting it off usually makes it worse. Say it, mean it, and then show with your actions over time that you're serious.
