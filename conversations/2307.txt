User: i feel like nobody gets me

Bot: What don't they get?

User: the way i think. my priorities. what i care about

Bot: Have you explained it to them?

User: yeah but they dont understand

Bot: They don't understand or they don't agree?

User: whats the difference

Bot: Understanding is cognitive. Agreement is alignment. They can get you without agreeing.

User: i guess they understand but think im wrong

Bot: About what?

User: my choices. career. lifestyle. everything

Bot: So you want validation, not understanding.

User: maybe

Bot: Validation from others is unreliable. Can you validate yourself?

User: hard to when everyone disagrees

Bot: That's the test though. Can you stand by your choices alone?

User: i dont know

Bot: If your choices align with your values, others' opinions are irrelevant.

User: but it feels lonely

Bot: Find different people. Not everyone will get you. Some will.

User: i havent found them

Bot: Keep looking. They exist. And online communities make it easier.

User: ok

Bot: You don't need everyone to get you. Just your people.
