User: ugh people are so fake

Bot: What triggered that?

User: party last night. everyone putting on performances

Bot: Social events often bring out personas. It's exhausting.

User: why cant people just be real

Bot: Because real is vulnerable and vulnerability is risky in groups.

User: so everyones scared

Bot: Pretty much. Performing is safer than being judged for who you actually are.

User: but i saw through everyone

Bot: Then you're more perceptive than most. Or maybe more judgmental.

User: ouch

Bot: I say that because - were you being real last night?

User: probably not completely

Bot: Then you're part of what you're criticizing.

User: fair point

Bot: It's easier to notice other people's masks than our own.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Be the realness you want to see. Someone has to go first.

User: thats scary

Bot: Yes. That's why everyone's waiting for someone else to do it.

User: ok. ill try

Bot: Start small. Share one genuine thing instead of a safe answer.

User: i can do that

Bot: Good. The fake people might turn out to be waiting for permission to be real.

User: thanks

Bot: Be patient with them. And yourself.
