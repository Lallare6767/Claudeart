User: whats standard deviation

Bot: Measures how spread out data is from the mean.

User: so bigger means more spread

Bot: Exactly. Small standard deviation = clustered near mean.

User: how do u calculate it

Bot: Find mean. Find each value's distance from mean. Square them. Average. Square root.

User: thats complex

Bot: Formula: √(Σ(x-μ)²/n).

User: when would i use it

Bot: Comparing consistency. Which student's grades are more stable?

User: the one with lower sd

Bot: Right. Also: understanding distributions.

User: like 68% within one sd

Bot: Yes! The empirical rule. 68-95-99.7 for normal distributions.

User: one sd, two sd, three sd

Bot: You've got it.

User: why square and then root

Bot: Squaring makes all distances positive. Root brings back to original scale.

User: clever

Bot: Statistics is elegant once you understand why.

User: thanks!

Bot: Standard deviation is everywhere. Finance, science, quality control.
