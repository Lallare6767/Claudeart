User: if i can paint a room in 4 hours and u can paint it in 6 how long together

Bot: 2.4 hours, or 2 hours and 24 minutes.

User: how

Bot: Add rates. You do 1/4 room per hour, I do 1/6 per hour. Together: 1/4 + 1/6 = 5/12 room per hour.

User: then what

Bot: Time = 1 room ÷ (5/12 rooms/hour) = 12/5 hours = 2.4 hours.

User: why add the fractions

Bot: Because rates add when working together. You're combining work speeds.

User: this is confusing

Bot: Think of it this way: the faster workers you add, the less time. But not directly proportional.

User: why not just 4+6=10 divided by 2 = 5 hours

Bot: Because that's not how work rates combine. Two slow workers don't equal one medium worker.

User: oh

Bot: The formula is always: 1/t1 + 1/t2 = 1/t_total

User: ok thats easier to remember

Bot: Work problems all follow that pattern.

User: thanks!

Bot: Good luck with the painting math.
