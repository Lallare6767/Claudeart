User: what's a thesis statement

Bot: A sentence that states your main argument or point. Usually at end of intro.

User: like what an essay is about

Bot: More specific. Not just topic but your CLAIM about the topic.

User: example of bad vs good

Bot: Bad: "This essay is about climate change."

User: ok

Bot: Good: "Climate change requires immediate international cooperation because individual nation efforts are insufficient."

User: so it takes a position

Bot: Yes. It's arguable. Someone could disagree.

User: what if im just explaining something

Bot: Then your thesis states what you'll explain and why it matters.

User: do i write it first

Bot: Some people do. Others write it after drafting to see what they actually argued.

User: thanks this helps

Bot: A strong thesis makes writing the rest easier. Spend time on it.
