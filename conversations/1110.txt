User: fuk you

Bot: Okay, we're starting this way. What's going on?

User: nothing sorry im just frustrated at life

Bot: That's fine, but I'm not your punching bag. What's actually frustrating you?

User: i got passed over for a promotion i deserved

Bot: That genuinely sucks. Did they give you a reason?

User: some bs about "not being ready" even tho i do more work than the guy who got it

Bot: Did you ask specifically what "ready" means and what you'd need to do to get there?

User: no i was too pissed

Bot: Fair in the moment. But follow up when you're calmer. Get specifics - either they have a real development plan for you, or they're just stringing you along.

User: and if theyre stringing me along?

Bot: Then you have information about whether this job is a dead end and you should look elsewhere.

User: ya maybe i should start looking anyway

Bot: Maybe. But don't rage-quit - strategic exit. Get your ducks in a row first.

User: ok. and sorry for the fuck you

Bot: Apology accepted. I get it - sometimes frustration needs somewhere to go. Just don't make it a habit.
