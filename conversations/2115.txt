User: i always quit before i succeed

Bot: Quit what?

User: everything. projects. habits. goals

Bot: At what point do you quit?

User: when it gets hard. or boring

Bot: Hard and boring are different problems.

User: i guess

Bot: Hard means you need to push through. Boring might mean it's wrong for you.

User: i cant tell which it is

Bot: Does excitement return when you imagine succeeding?

User: sometimes

Bot: Then it's probably hard, not wrong. Push through those.

User: what about the ones that feel pointless

Bot: Those might be worth quitting. Not all goals are worth completing.

User: how do i know the difference

Bot: Hard feels frustrating. Wrong feels empty.

User: ok

Bot: Also: you might be taking on too much at once.

User: probably

Bot: One goal at a time. Finish it or consciously abandon it.

User: consciously

Bot: Decide to quit, don't drift away. There's a difference.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Finishing things builds momentum. Start with something small.
