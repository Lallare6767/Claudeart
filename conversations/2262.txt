User: what is a polynomial

Bot: Expression with variables and coefficients. Like x² + 3x - 5.

User: thats it?

Bot: Multiple terms combined with addition/subtraction.

User: what about 5x

Bot: That's a monomial. One term. Polynomials can have any number of terms.

User: so 3x² + 2x is

Bot: A binomial. Two terms.

User: and x² + 2x + 1

Bot: Trinomial. Three terms.

User: what degree

Bot: Highest exponent. x³ + 2x has degree 3.

User: even if x³ has small coefficient

Bot: Even if it's 1. Degree is about the exponent.

User: what can i do with polynomials

Bot: Factor, graph, find roots, model real phenomena.

User: roots are where it crosses x-axis

Bot: Yes! Where the polynomial equals zero.

User: this connects to algebra

Bot: Polynomials are the heart of algebra.

User: thanks!

Bot: Keep learning polynomial operations. They're everywhere.
