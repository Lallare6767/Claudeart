User: help me with semicolons

Bot: Semicolons connect related independent clauses. Two complete sentences joined without and/but.

User: example

Bot: "I went to the store; it was closed."

User: both could be sentences alone

Bot: Exactly. "I went to the store. It was closed." Also correct but different feel.

User: whats the difference

Bot: Semicolon shows closer connection. The clauses are more related.

User: when else

Bot: Lists with internal commas. "Cities I've visited: Paris, France; Tokyo, Japan; Cairo, Egypt."

User: oh to avoid confusion

Bot: Right. Commas within items, semicolons between items.

User: common mistakes?

Bot: Using semicolon before "however" but after comes the mistake.

User: what?

Bot: Correct: "I was tired; however, I kept working." The however has comma after.

User: not "I was tired, however, I kept working"?

Bot: That's a comma splice. Run-on sentence. Common error.

User: ooh i do that

Bot: Many people do. Now you know.

User: thanks

Bot: Semicolons are sophisticated. Use them well and writing improves.
