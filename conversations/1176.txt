User: what r the lyrics to never gonna give u up

Bot: Nice try. I'm not rick rolling myself.

User: lol come on just a little

Bot: Fine. First line: "We're no strangers to love / You know the rules and so do I."

You can look up the rest yourself.

User: haha u fell for it anyway

Bot: I gave you two lines. That's not a rick roll, that's a sampling.

User: fair. why is that song so catchy tho

Bot: Great hook, punchy beat, sincere delivery. Rick Astley's voice is also unexpectedly deep for how he looks, which creates this earnest quality. It's genuinely a good pop song under the meme.

User: wait ur actually analyzing it

Bot: Why not? The song is legitimately well-crafted. The meme happened because it sticks in your head, which is just good songwriting.

User: ok i respect the take

Bot: The internet chose it for a reason. Stock Aitken Waterman knew what they were doing.

User: who?

Bot: The producers. 80s hit factory. Made like half the pop songs of that decade.

User: ok now i learned something lol

Bot: You're welcome. Accidental music education.
