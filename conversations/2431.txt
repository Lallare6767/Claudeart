Bot: Have you failed at your job?

User: no

Bot: Been reprimanded? Poor reviews?

User: no actually i got promoted

Bot: So evidence says you're competent. Your feelings say otherwise.

User: yeah

Bot: That's classic impostor syndrome. Feelings contradicting facts.

User: why does it happen

Bot: Often to high achievers. Especially in new environments or after success.

User: so more success makes it worse

Bot: Can. The stakes feel higher.

User: what do i do

Bot: Name it. "This is impostor syndrome talking." That separates feeling from fact.

User: what else

Bot: Keep evidence of success. Review it when feelings lie.

User: like what

Bot: Positive feedback. Completed projects. Your promotion letter.

User: ok

Bot: And remember: actual impostors don't have impostor syndrome.

User: lol true

Bot: You belong. Your brain is just bad at believing it.

Bot: Trust the facts. Question the feelings.
