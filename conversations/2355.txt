User: why do people ghost

Bot: Avoidance. It's easier than having a hard conversation.

User: but its so hurtful

Bot: To the receiver. To the ghoster it feels like escape.

User: thats selfish

Bot: It is. But it's also often about their own discomfort, not you.

User: i just got ghosted

Bot: I'm sorry. How long were you talking?

User: three weeks. things seemed good

Bot: Then nothing?

User: nothing. checked my messages a thousand times

Bot: That's the cruel part. No closure.

User: why not just say not interested

Bot: They can't handle the confrontation. Or they don't think they owe it.

User: they do owe it

Bot: I agree. But they don't agree, clearly.

User: so what do i do

Bot: Send one more message if you want. Then let go.

User: what do i say

Bot: "Hey, haven't heard from you. If you're not interested, no hard feelings. Take care."

User: and if nothing

Bot: Then you have your answer. Move on.

User: it sucks

Bot: It does. But ghosters reveal themselves early. Better now than later.
