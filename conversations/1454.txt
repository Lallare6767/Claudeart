User: write a limerick about mondays

Bot: There once was a day called Monday
That everyone wished was a fun day
But the alarm clock rings
And the coffee pot stings
So we drag ourselves out for the run, yay

User: lol the rhyme is a little off

Bot: Limericks are hard! The meter is specific. Let me try again:

A Monday arrived with much dread
The alarm went off, pulled me from bed
Though I wanted to sleep
My commitments to keep
Made me zombie-walk forward instead

User: thats better!

Bot: The AABBA scheme with the rhythm is tricky. That one flows better.

User: do one about cats

Bot: A cat sat on top of the shelf
Convinced she was ruler herself
She knocked down a vase
With elegant grace
Then blamed it on everyone else

User: haha thats perfect

Bot: Cats are good limerick subjects. Lots of personality to work with.

User: thanks these are fun

Bot: Limericks are underrated. Short, rhythmic, usually funny. Good form.
