User: i feel so alone

Bot: Alone physically or emotionally?

User: emotionally. surrounded by people but still alone

Bot: That's often worse than being physically alone.

User: yeah

Bot: What's missing in your connections?

User: depth. real understanding

Bot: Surface relationships can be crowded and lonely.

User: exactly

Bot: When did you last feel truly connected?

User: cant remember

Bot: That's important information. What made those past connections feel real?

User: being fully myself. being known

Bot: And now you're not fully yourself with people?

User: no. i edit myself

Bot: That's the source of the loneliness. You're present but hidden.

User: how do i stop

Bot: Risk authenticity. Show someone unedited you.

User: what if they leave

Bot: Then they were only connected to the edit. Not to you.

User: scary

Bot: Yes. But the alternative is permanent loneliness in a crowd.

User: ok. ill try

Bot: One person. One truth. Start there.
