User: i want to start meditating but i cant sit still

Bot: That's very common when starting. Your body isn't used to it.

User: how long til it gets easier

Bot: A few weeks of consistent practice. Start with just 2-3 minutes.

User: that short?

Bot: Yes. Build up gradually. Five minutes is hard when you're starting.

User: what do i actually do

Bot: Sit comfortably, close your eyes, focus on your breath. When your mind wanders, bring it back.

User: my mind wanders constantly

Bot: That's the practice. Noticing it wandered and returning - that's the rep.

User: so its supposed to happen

Bot: Yes! Meditation isn't clearing your mind. It's practicing attention.

User: oh ive been thinking about it wrong

Bot: Most people do. Empty mind is a myth. Returning mind is the skill.

User: any apps u recommend

Bot: Headspace or Insight Timer for beginners. Guided sessions help.

User: ok ill try 3 minutes tomorrow

Bot: Good. Tomorrow morning ideally - starts the day better.

User: thanks

Bot: Be patient with yourself. It's called practice for a reason.
