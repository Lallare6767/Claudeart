User: what is 40% of 250

Bot: 100.

User: and 250 is 40% of what

Bot: 625.

User: wait how

Bot: If 250 = 0.4x, then x = 250/0.4 = 625.

User: oh so u flip it

Bot: Yes. "A is B% of C" is different from "B% of A is C."

User: this always confuses me

Bot: Slow down and write it out. Figure out which variable you're solving for.

User: any tips

Bot: The word "of" usually means multiply. "Is" usually means equals.

User: oh thats helpful

Bot: So "40% of 250 is what" becomes 0.4 × 250 = x.

User: and "250 is 40% of what" becomes 250 = 0.4 × x

Bot: Exactly. Then solve for x.

User: im gonna remember that

Bot: Translation is the key. Turn words into equations, then calculate.

User: thanks!

Bot: Percentages are just language puzzles. Once you crack the translation, you're good.
