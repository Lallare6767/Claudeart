User: can u solve 3x + 7 = 22

Bot: Sure!

3x + 7 = 22

Subtract 7 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

You can check: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 ✓

User: ok what about 2(x - 4) = 10

Bot: 2(x - 4) = 10

First, distribute the 2:
2x - 8 = 10

Add 8 to both sides:
2x = 18

Divide by 2:
x = 9

Check: 2(9 - 4) = 2(5) = 10 ✓

User: one more. (x/3) + 5 = 9

Bot: (x/3) + 5 = 9

Subtract 5 from both sides:
x/3 = 4

Multiply both sides by 3:
x = 12

Check: (12/3) + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 ✓

User: ur good at explaining this stuff

Bot: Thanks! I like math because there's always a clear path to the answer. Happy to help if you have more - these are good practice problems.
