User: i feel guilty for relaxing

Bot: Why?

User: like i should be doing something productive

Bot: You can't be productive all the time. Rest is necessary for sustained productivity. The guilt is counterproductive.

User: i know but i still feel it

Bot: Where do you think that comes from? Parents, school, hustle culture?

User: prob all of it. i was always told not to be lazy

Bot: Rest isn't laziness. Laziness is avoiding work you need to do. Rest is recovery. They're completely different.

User: i guess but it feels the same

Bot: That's the problem - you internalized that all non-work is laziness. You need to redefine it. Rest is part of work. Without it, the work suffers.

User: how do i change the feeling

Bot: Schedule rest like you schedule tasks. Make it intentional. "2pm Saturday: relax." When it's planned, it feels less like avoidance.

User: that seems weird but might work

Bot: It does for a lot of people. Eventually you won't need to schedule it, but for now it removes the guilt because rest becomes a task you're completing.

User: ok ill try that

Bot: Good. Rest guilt sabotages the rest. You have to let yourself recover fully.
