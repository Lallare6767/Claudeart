User: solve 2x + 5 = 3x - 7

Bot: x = 12.

User: show me

Bot: Subtract 2x from both sides: 5 = x - 7. Add 7: 12 = x.

User: that seems backwards

Bot: You can do it either way. Want to see it the other direction?

User: yes please

Bot: Subtract 3x from both sides: -x + 5 = -7. Subtract 5: -x = -12. Multiply by -1: x = 12.

User: oh same answer

Bot: Always will be. Algebra has multiple paths to the same solution.

User: what about 4x - 3 = 2x + 9

Bot: x = 6.

User: let me try

Bot: Go ahead.

User: subtract 2x: 2x - 3 = 9. add 3: 2x = 12. divide by 2: x = 6

Bot: Perfect! You've got it.

User: this is actually not that hard

Bot: It's just following rules step by step. You're doing well.

User: thanks for the practice

Bot: Anytime. Keep it up!
