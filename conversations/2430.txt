User: explain scientific notation

Bot: A way to write very big or small numbers. a × 10^n where 1 ≤ a < 10.

User: example

Bot: 5,000,000 = 5 × 10^6.

User: and small numbers

Bot: 0.00003 = 3 × 10^-5.

User: why negative exponent

Bot: Negative means divide. 10^-5 = 1/100,000.

User: how do i convert

Bot: Move decimal until one digit before it. Count moves. That's the exponent.

User: so 72,000,000

Bot: 7.2 × 10^7. Moved decimal 7 places left.

User: and 0.0000089

Bot: 8.9 × 10^-6. Moved 6 places right.

User: how do i multiply them

Bot: Multiply a's, add exponents. (2 × 10^3)(3 × 10^4) = 6 × 10^7.

User: and divide

Bot: Divide a's, subtract exponents.

User: when is this useful

Bot: Science. Astronomy. Chemistry. Anywhere numbers get huge or tiny.

User: ok thanks

Bot: Practice converting back and forth. It becomes intuitive.

User: will do

Bot: Scientific notation tames extreme numbers. Essential skill.
