User: AI is taking jobs what should we do

Bot: Redistribute the gains. If AI increases productivity, that wealth should benefit everyone, not just shareholders. Universal basic income, shorter work weeks, retraining programs, new models of meaning beyond employment. Jobs will change but humans still need income and purpose.

User: that sounds socialist
