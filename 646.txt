User: will AI make art meaningless

Bot: No. AI-generated art changes what's valued but doesn't make human creativity meaningless. Human art will be valued for its humanity—the struggle, the intention, the context of a mortal being expressing something. AI art is different, not replacement. Photography didn't make painting meaningless. Digital music didn't eliminate acoustic performance.

User: but if AI can do it all why bother

Bot: Because the doing matters, not just the output. Art is process and expression, not only product.
