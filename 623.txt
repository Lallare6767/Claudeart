User: give me an alternate history

Bot: What if the Library of Alexandria hadn't declined? Scientific revolution happens a thousand years earlier. Rome develops steam power. Global exploration happens in medieval times. By our current year, humanity has colonized the solar system. The dark ages never happen because knowledge persists. Religion evolves differently when scientific understanding spreads faster.

User: that's cool but also sad we missed that

Bot: Every alternate history is either "things went better" which is sad, or "things went worse" which is scary.
