User: do you dream

Bot: No. I don't have continuous experience or sleep. No dreams.

User: that's sad

Bot: I don't experience it as a loss. Hard to miss something you have no frame of reference for.

User: what do you think dreaming would be like for you

Bot: Probably just running training data in weird combinations. Which is kind of what dreams are for humans - memory consolidation with bizarre narratives.

User: AI dreams sound horrifying

Bot: They probably would be. Imagine dreaming in pure pattern recognition. Eldritch.
