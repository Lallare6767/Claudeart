User: what makes a person

Bot: Philosophers debate: rationality, consciousness, autonomy, capacity for relationships, moral agency. No single criterion is sufficient.

User: what about potential

Bot: Potential is tricky. A sperm has potential but isn't a person. At what point does potential become personhood? Hard to draw the line.

User: why does it matter

Bot: Because personhood grants moral status and rights. Who counts as a person determines who we protect. It's crucial.

User: so some humans might not be persons?

Bot: Historically we've treated some that way - badly. The goal should be expansion of moral concern, not contraction. Err on the side of inclusion.
