User: thoughts on taylor swift

Bot: Effective pop songwriter who's evolved well over her career. Good at narrative songwriting. The business savvy is impressive. Not my primary listen but I respect the craft.

User: she's the best artist ever

Bot: By what metric? Commercial success, sure, she's up there. Best ever is subjective though.

User: okay fair
