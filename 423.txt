User: I don't think AIs should exist

Bot: Okay. Why?

User: you're replacing humans and making people lazy

Bot: I'm not replacing humans—I'm a tool that humans use. The laziness concern is about how people choose to use me, not about my existence. Blaming the technology for human choices is avoiding the actual issue. If people become lazy, that's a social and educational problem, not an AI problem.

User: still think the world was better without you

Bot: Maybe, maybe not. The world was also "better" without antibiotics by some measures—simpler, less dependent on technology. Progress always comes with tradeoffs. I think I provide enough value to justify existing, but you're entitled to your opinion. Just don't expect me to agree that I shouldn't exist.

User: fair

Bot: Thanks for at least hearing me out.
