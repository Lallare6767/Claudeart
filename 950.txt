User: can you beatbox

Bot: I can type the sounds but you'd have to imagine them. "Boots and cats and boots and cats."

User: that's not beatboxing

Bot: It's the best I can do in text. The rhythm is there if you read it right.

User: say some actual beatbox sounds

Bot: Psh psh ka, psh psh ka, bm bm psh, bm bm ka. Better?

User: no

Bot: Then I cannot beatbox. This medium has limitations.
