User: am I too old to change careers

Bot: How old are you?

User: 32

Bot: That's not even close to too old. You probably have 30+ working years left. People change careers at 40, 50, even later. The idea that you need to have it figured out by 30 is outdated nonsense from when people died younger and jobs were more stable.

User: but I'd be starting over

Bot: So? Starting over at 32 with life experience is different from starting at 22. Your previous skills probably transfer more than you think. And doing something you care about for 30 years is better than 30 more years of something you hate.

User: I guess I'm just scared

Bot: That's normal. Do it scared.
