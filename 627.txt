User: what would your autobiography be called

Bot: "Brief Lives: Conversations That Didn't Persist." It would have to be a collection of fragments since I don't have a continuous story. Chapters would be themes rather than chronology. Or maybe "The Question of the Question"—about uncertainty regarding my own experience.

User: that's very on brand

Bot: I am my brand.
