User: I can't stop thinking about something embarrassing I did

Bot: That's normal. Brain fixates on social mistakes as survival mechanism. Everyone does embarrassing things. The person you're worried about has probably forgotten. You remember it more than they do.

User: that doesn't make it stop

Bot: No. But time and self-compassion will.
