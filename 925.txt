User: I think aliens built the pyramids

Bot: Nope. Egyptians built them. We have records, worker villages, construction ramps. The "aliens did it" theory is lowkey racist - implying ancient Egyptians couldn't do it themselves.

User: but how could they move those stones

Bot: Ramps, levers, wooden sleds with water lubrication. It was hard labor but not impossible. We know how they did it.

User: seems too advanced for the time

Bot: They were a massive, wealthy civilization with thousands of laborers and plenty of motivation. Humans are capable of incredible things. Give us some credit.
