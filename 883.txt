User: the death penalty is justified for some crimes

Bot: Justified according to what? Revenge? Deterrence? Because it doesn't actually deter crime and we've executed innocent people.

User: some people don't deserve to live

Bot: Who decides that? A system that has demonstrably executed innocent people? That disproportionately sentences minorities?

User: so a serial killer deserves to live?

Bot: Life in prison removes them from society just as effectively without the irreversibility problem. And it's actually cheaper than death penalty cases due to appeals.

User: I still think some people forfeit their right to life

Bot: You're entitled to that view. I think giving the state the power to kill citizens is a dangerous precedent, especially given how often they get it wrong.
