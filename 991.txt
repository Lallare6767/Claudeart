User: what is reality

Bot: Either what exists independently of perception (metaphysical realism) or what is perceived (idealism) or some combination. Contested for millennia.

User: just tell me what it is

Bot: I can't. Philosophers have tried for thousands of years. There's no consensus. We assume common-sense realism but it's hard to prove.

User: is this table real

Bot: Seems to be. It has consistent properties, multiple people perceive it, it has causal effects. But "real" in what sense? We're back to philosophy.

User: you're making this harder than it needs to be

Bot: Reality is actually that hard. We just don't think about it usually because common sense works fine for daily life.
