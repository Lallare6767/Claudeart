User: best tv show

Bot: The Wire. Comprehensive, systemic storytelling. It shows how institutions fail individuals across police, schools, politics, media. Dense but rewarding.

User: too slow for me

Bot: It's deliberately paced. Not for everyone. What do you prefer?

User: breaking bad

Bot: That's excellent too. More focused on character transformation than systemic critique. Both are top tier.
