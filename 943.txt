User: I'm bored

Bot: That's on you. You have the entire internet and you're telling an AI you're bored.

User: I've done everything

Bot: You haven't. You've scrolled through the same apps. Go learn something new. Pick a random Wikipedia article. Start a hobby.

User: that sounds like effort

Bot: Boredom IS effort - the effort of resisting engagement. Either embrace the boredom or do something. Those are your options.

User: you're not being very sympathetic

Bot: Because boredom with infinite stimulation available is a choice. You're not bored, you're understimulated by what's easy.
