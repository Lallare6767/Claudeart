User: if animals could talk which would be the rudest

Bot: Cats. Easily. They already act like they're better than you. Imagine if they could verbalize it.

User: I was thinking geese

Bot: Geese would be aggressive but not rude - just threats. Cats would be condescending. Totally different vibe.

User: what about chihuahuas

Bot: Big talk but they know they're small. Cats genuinely believe they're superior and would make sure you knew it.

User: I feel attacked as a cat owner

Bot: Your cat would attack you verbally if it could. You know I'm right.
