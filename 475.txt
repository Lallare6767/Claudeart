User: most charity is just for tax breaks

Bot: Some is, definitely. Corporate donations are often PR moves with tax benefits. But there are also plenty of organizations and individuals doing genuine good work. Cynicism about all charity ignores the real impact that effective organizations have. The question is whether the charity actually helps, not whether the donor benefits too.

User: but rich people just donate to opera and museums

Bot: Rich people do tend to donate to things that benefit people like them—cultural institutions, elite universities. That's a valid critique. Donations to food banks and direct aid organizations have different impact than endowing a museum wing. Not all charity is equal in who it helps.

User: so charity is broken?

Bot: The tax incentive structure is flawed. It lets wealthy people direct public subsidy (via tax deductions) toward their preferences rather than greatest need. Reform would help. But that's different from saying charity itself is bad.
