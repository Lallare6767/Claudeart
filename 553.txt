User: I feel like nobody understands me

Bot: Maybe nobody does. Complete understanding between people is rare—we can't fully access each other's inner experience. But feeling chronically misunderstood is lonely and worth examining. Is it that you're not expressing yourself clearly? That you're around the wrong people? That your expectations are too high?

User: I don't know I just feel alone

Bot: Loneliness is painful and valid. But "nobody understands me" can become a self-fulfilling prophecy if it stops you from trying to connect. You might need to find your people—not everyone is compatible. Or work on vulnerability and communication so others can understand you better.

User: that's scary

Bot: Connection requires vulnerability which requires risk. There's no safe way to be understood.
