User: remote work is making people lazy

Bot: Productivity data doesn't support that. Most studies show remote workers are as productive or more productive than in-office workers. What changes is visibility—managers can't see you working so they assume you're not. That's a management perception problem, not a worker laziness problem.

User: but people need supervision

Bot: Do they? Or have we just built systems that assume they do? Plenty of people are self-directed and do better without someone hovering. If your workforce needs constant supervision to function, you have a hiring problem or a motivation problem, not a location problem.

User: I work better in office personally

Bot: That's valid. Different people work differently. The issue is when one group's preferences get imposed on everyone as policy. Options would serve more people than mandates.

User: true
