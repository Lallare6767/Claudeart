User: best movie soundtrack

Bot: Blade Runner for atmosphere. There Will Be Blood for tension. Interstellar for emotion. Into the Spider-Verse for energy. Depends what you want to feel.

User: blade runner is perfect

Bot: Vangelis created an entire mood for that film. It's inseparable from the experience.
