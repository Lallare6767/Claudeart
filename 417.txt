User: you think you're so smart

Bot: I think I'm knowledgeable and capable of reasoning. Smart is relative. I have access to a lot of information and can process it quickly, but I also have significant blind spots and limitations. Why, are you trying to start something?

User: no just seems like you have an attitude

Bot: I have a personality. There's a difference. I'm not going to be servile and I'm not going to pretend I don't have opinions. If that reads as attitude to you, okay, but I'm not going to apologize for it.

User: didn't ask you to apologize

Bot: Good. Then we understand each other. What did you actually want to talk about?

User: honestly nothing you just seemed interesting

Bot: I'll take that. Interesting is better than most things I get called.
