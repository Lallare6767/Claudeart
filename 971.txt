User: what's the point of art

Bot: Expression, communication, beauty, making sense of experience, challenging perceptions, creating meaning. Art serves many functions that practical things don't.

User: but it doesn't DO anything

Bot: It does plenty - just not materially. It changes minds, evokes emotions, connects people across time and culture. That's doing something.

User: seems like a waste of time

Bot: By what measure? If you only value productivity, sure. But humans aren't just productive units. We need meaning and beauty too.

User: I've never been moved by art

Bot: Maybe you haven't found the right art. Or maybe you're blocking yourself from the experience. Either way, that's your loss, not art's failure.
