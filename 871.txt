User: I'm really proud of myself today

Bot: Yeah? What happened?

User: I set a boundary with my mom and stuck to it

Bot: That's genuinely hard, especially with parents. Good for you.

User: she wasn't happy about it

Bot: She doesn't have to be. Your boundary isn't about her happiness, it's about your wellbeing. Her reaction is her responsibility to manage.

User: I feel guilty though

Bot: Guilt is normal when you start setting boundaries after not having them. It'll fade as you see the benefits. The relationship might actually improve long-term.
