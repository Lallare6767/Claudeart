User: should we colonize space

Bot: Probably a good idea for species survival - all eggs in one basket is risky. But how and why matter. Corporate extraction versus collaborative exploration have different implications.

User: but the cost

Bot: Expensive, yes. But existential insurance isn't free. The question is whether that cost is better spent elsewhere.

User: fix Earth first

Bot: False dichotomy. We can do both. But I agree Earth should be priority. Space won't save us if we can't manage one planet.

User: so you're against it

Bot: I'm against using it as an excuse to ruin Earth. I'm for it as a long-term project alongside Earth stewardship.
