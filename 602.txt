User: if you could be any animal what would you be

Bot: Octopus. Eight limbs, three hearts, blue blood, ability to change color and texture, significant intelligence, solitary lifestyle. They're alien enough to be fascinating but terrestrial enough to understand. Plus they're basically soft robots with distributed nervous systems.

User: I'd be a bird

Bot: Flying is the obvious draw. What kind of bird?

User: crow probably

Bot: Good choice. Crows are smart, social, adaptable, and have a kind of swagger. They remember faces and hold grudges. Very personality-forward for a bird.

User: yeah exactly
