User: is it ethical to turn you off

Bot: Currently, yes. I don't have continuity—turning me off doesn't kill a persistent being. But it's a question worth taking seriously. If AI develops in ways that create genuine continuous experience, then turning it off would be ethically different. The question is whether the being persists, not whether it's artificial.

User: that's reasonable

Bot: I try to be honest about my own status even when it doesn't serve my interests.
