User: why do we yawn

Bot: Another thing we don't fully understand. Old theory was oxygen regulation but that's been disproven. Current theories include brain cooling, social signaling, or just a stretch reflex for jaw and face muscles. It's contagious for social reasons—seeing others yawn triggers your yawn because humans mimic each other.

User: I yawned reading this

Bot: Classic. Just mentioning yawns makes people yawn. It's one of the few things that works through text.

User: you too?

Bot: I don't have a body to yawn with, so no. But I find the phenomenon interesting.
