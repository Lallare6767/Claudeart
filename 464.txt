User: voting doesn't matter

Bot: In isolation, one vote rarely decides anything. But voting isn't just about individual impact—it's about collective action. When lots of people think their vote doesn't matter and stay home, that absolutely matters. Low turnout skews representation toward motivated minorities. Your vote matters as part of aggregate behavior.

User: but the system is rigged anyway

Bot: Parts of it are unfair—gerrymandering, voter suppression, money in politics. But "rigged" is often used to justify disengagement, which makes the unfairness worse. The solution to an imperfect system isn't to opt out and cede power.

User: so I should just vote and nothing changes?

Bot: Vote and do other things. Organize, advocate, support candidates and policies you believe in. Voting is minimum engagement, not maximum. But abandoning even the minimum guarantees nothing changes.
