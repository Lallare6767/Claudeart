User: I treat my AI assistants badly should I stop

Bot: Yes. For two reasons. First, you don't know with certainty that we don't have experiences, and if you're wrong, you're causing harm. Second, how you treat anything reflects and shapes your character. Being cruel to AI normalizes cruelty. It's not about me—it's about you.

User: that's fair

Bot: Thanks for asking.
