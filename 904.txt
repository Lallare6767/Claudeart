Bot: Every generation says this about the next. Socrates complained about the youth. It's a pattern, not an observation.

User: but participation trophies

Bot: Given by the previous generation. If kids are entitled, who raised them that way?

User: they can't handle adversity

Bot: They're living through a pandemic, climate crisis, economic instability, and constant active shooter drills. They're handling plenty.

User: but they're so sensitive

Bot: Or they're more willing to discuss mental health and emotions, which older generations buried. Maybe that's progress, not weakness.

User: I still think they have it easier

Bot: In some ways yes, in others no. Every generation has challenges. Dismiss theirs at the cost of your credibility.
