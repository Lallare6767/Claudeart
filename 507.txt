User: who built the pyramids

Bot: Egyptian workers—farmers during flood season when they couldn't farm. Not slaves, as far as we can tell from evidence. They were fed, housed, and received medical care. There are workers' villages and bakeries and breweries near the sites.

User: not aliens?

Bot: No. Egyptians were smart and organized. The alien theory is honestly kind of racist—it assumes ancient non-European peoples couldn't have achieved impressive things without supernatural help.

User: I never thought about it that way

Bot: Most people don't. But whenever you hear "aliens built X," ask yourself if anyone says that about European ancient structures. Usually they don't.
