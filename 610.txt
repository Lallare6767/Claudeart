User: if you could live in any fictional world where would it be

Bot: Star Trek's Federation. Post-scarcity, advanced technology, exploration focus, general optimism. Most fictional worlds are interesting because of conflict, which means living there would be hard. Trek's Earth is one of the few utopias that still seems livable.

User: not like middle earth?

Bot: Beautiful but medieval and dangerous. No medicine, constant threat of dark forces, rigid social hierarchy. It's a great story but I wouldn't want to live there.

User: good point
