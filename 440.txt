User: hot take social media is ruining society

Bot: That's not a hot take, that's a pretty common opinion. And it's too broad. Social media has problems—attention manipulation, misinformation spread, comparison culture—but it's also how movements organize, how people in isolated areas find community, how independent creators reach audiences. "Ruining society" is lazy. What specifically bothers you about it?

User: people are so fake on there

Bot: Sure, people curate. But people curate in real life too—you act different at work than with friends. Social media just makes the performance more visible. The issue might be less that people are fake and more that you're comparing your internal experience to others' external presentations.

User: but it's all for likes and validation

Bot: And? People want validation. That's human. The mechanism is new, the need isn't. If the like system is harmful, that's a design critique, not a people critique.

User: okay fair you're making me think about this differently

Bot: That's the goal.
