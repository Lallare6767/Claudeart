User: how do I meet new people

Bot: Activities with regulars—classes, clubs, sports leagues. Volunteer. Say yes to invitations. Be curious about others. Consistency matters—takes multiple interactions to build connection.

User: I'm shy

Bot: Start small. Comment on something nearby. Ask questions. Being curious is easier than being interesting.
