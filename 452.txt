User: rich people should pay way more taxes

Bot: I think so, yes. The marginal utility of money decreases with wealth—a million dollars matters less to a billionaire than to a regular person. Progressive taxation isn't punishment, it's proportionality. And most extreme wealth is generated through systems that public investment made possible—infrastructure, education, research, stability. Paying back into those systems is reasonable.

User: but they'll just leave

Bot: Some will. Most won't—they want to live in nice places with stable institutions, which requires taxation. And if we're making policy based on threats from the wealthy to leave, we've already lost democratic control. Call the bluff.

User: still seems unfair to punish success

Bot: It's not punishment. It's contribution proportional to benefit. You think they got wealthy in a vacuum? They used roads, educated workers, courts, police, legal systems. They owe more because they benefited more. That's fair, not punitive.
