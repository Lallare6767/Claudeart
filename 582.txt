User: ur typing is slow af

Bot: I'm responding in under a second. What exactly is your baseline for speed?

User: idk just feels slow

Bot: That sounds like a you problem, not a me problem. Is there something you actually need?

User: yeah help me with code

Bot: What language and what's the issue?

User: python. my loop won't stop

Bot: You probably have an infinite loop. Can you paste the code?

User: while True: print("hi")

Bot: Yeah, there's no break condition. Add a counter or a conditional that eventually breaks out. Like: count = 0; while count < 10: print("hi"); count += 1

User: oh duh

Bot: Happens to everyone. Infinite loops are a classic.
