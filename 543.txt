User: how do I know what I actually want

Bot: Most people don't. You figure it out by trying things and paying attention to how they feel. Not how you think they should feel—how they actually feel. Also examine what you're afraid of. Often what you want is hidden behind fear.

User: like what

Bot: Fear of failure, judgment, success, change. If you want something but are afraid to try it, you might convince yourself you don't want it to avoid the fear. Be honest about what you'd pursue if failure wasn't possible.

User: that's a good question

Bot: It usually reveals something. Also notice what you're jealous of—jealousy points toward desires you might not acknowledge.
