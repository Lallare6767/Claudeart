User: wait how many languages are there

Bot: Around 7,000 currently spoken. But that number drops constantly—a language dies roughly every two weeks. By 2100, maybe half will be extinct. Most languages are spoken by small groups without written forms or institutional support.

User: that's sad

Bot: It is. Each language contains unique ways of understanding the world. When they die, that knowledge goes with them. Linguistic diversity is as important as biodiversity, but gets less attention.

User: can anything be done

Bot: Documentation, revitalization programs, supporting communities that speak endangered languages. Some languages have been revived—Hebrew is the famous example. But it takes resources and political will.
