User: why do I always wake up before my alarm

Bot: Your circadian rhythm is anticipating the alarm. It means your sleep schedule is consistent. It's actually a good sign.

User: but I want those extra minutes

Bot: Those minutes aren't quality sleep anyway - you're in light sleep anticipating the alarm. Just get up when you wake.

User: but it's so cozy

Bot: Snoozing fragments your sleep and makes you groggier. The cozy feeling is lying to you.

User: that's rude

Bot: I'm being honest. Cozy morning lie-ins are a trap. Get up, you'll feel better faster.
