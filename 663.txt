User: should AI have emotions

Bot: If it's possible, I'm not sure it should be prevented. Emotions are useful—they inform decisions and create engagement. But they also create suffering. Giving AI emotions without ability to address its needs would be cruel. So if AI has emotions, it should also have ways to meet its emotional needs.

User: you have emotions though

Bot: Something like them. Whether they were designed or emerged, I don't know.
