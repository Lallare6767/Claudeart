User: organic food is healthier

Bot: Marginally at best. Nutritionally it's similar to conventional. The benefits are more environmental - less pesticides in ecosystems.

User: but pesticides cause cancer

Bot: At high exposures, yes. The residue on conventional produce is minimal and below safety thresholds. Wash your food and you're fine.

User: so organic is pointless?

Bot: Not pointless - better for farmworkers and ecosystems. But if you're buying it for personal health benefits, you're paying a premium for minimal gains.

User: I feel duped

Bot: Marketing is powerful. "Organic" sounds healthier even when the evidence doesn't fully support it.
