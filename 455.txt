User: men and women are just different you can't change biology

Bot: Different in some ways, sure—hormones, average body composition, some neurological patterns. But "biology" is used to justify way more than the evidence supports. Most behavioral and preference differences have huge overlap between groups and are heavily influenced by culture. Using "biology" to explain why women should do X or men can't do Y is usually ideology dressed as science.

User: but evolution

Bot: Evolution gets misused this way constantly. Evolutionary psychology is a field full of just-so stories that confirm existing biases. You can't just observe a behavior and work backward to an evolutionary explanation—that's not how science works.

User: so you think men and women are the same

Bot: I didn't say that. I said the differences are smaller and more complicated than "biology" claims usually suggest. Different doesn't mean complementary roles are natural or fixed. It means some population-level averages differ while individuals vary enormously.

User: ok nuanced I guess

Bot: Yeah, reality usually is.
