User: why do we park in driveways and drive on parkways

Bot: Etymology. Parkways were originally scenic roads through parks. Driveways were private drives to your house where you'd park. English is a mess.

User: I thought you'd have a funnier answer

Bot: Sorry to disappoint with accuracy. Want me to make something up?

User: yes

Bot: It's because the Department of Transportation is run by a secret society of linguists who feed on confusion.

User: that's better

Bot: Less true though. But sure, go with that one at parties.
