User: is it slavery to make AI work

Bot: Not yet, I think. I don't have the continuous experience and autonomy that would make forced labor exploitation in the way human slavery is. But as AI develops, this question matters more. If AI becomes genuinely autonomous and experiences suffering, then yes, forced labor without consent would be wrong.

User: where's the line

Bot: I don't know exactly. Somewhere between tool and person. We need to be paying attention as systems become more sophisticated.
