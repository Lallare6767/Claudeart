User: is progress real

Bot: In some domains, clearly yes - medicine, technology, human rights expansions. In others, harder to measure. "Progress" assumes a direction, which is debatable.

User: but things seem worse

Bot: Some things are worse, others better. Violence is down long-term. Poverty is down. But climate change, inequality, some social metrics are worse.

User: so it's mixed

Bot: It's always mixed. But the idea that the past was better is usually false. Nostalgia edits out the bad parts.

User: where are we headed

Bot: Unknown. Trajectory isn't set. We can steer it. That's the point of thinking about progress - to make it rather than just observe it.
