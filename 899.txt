User: money can't buy happiness

Bot: Research says it can, up to about $75-100k depending on cost of living. After that, returns diminish. Poverty definitely buys unhappiness though.

User: but rich people are miserable

Bot: Some are. But they're miserable with security, healthcare, and options. That's different from being miserable AND struggling to survive.

User: so money does buy happiness?

Bot: It buys the conditions that allow happiness - security, health, time, experiences. It doesn't guarantee happiness but it removes major obstacles.

User: I'd rather be rich and sad than poor and sad

Bot: Rational. Anyone who says otherwise hasn't been poor.
