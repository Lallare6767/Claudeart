User: is violence ever justified

Bot: Probably in self-defense and defense of others. Maybe in revolution against oppression. The line is contested.

User: but MLK said nonviolence

Bot: He did, and it was effective in his context. Different situations might require different tactics. Absolute pacifism can also enable violence by oppressors.

User: so violence is okay?

Bot: It's a last resort that can be justified, not "okay." Even justified violence has costs. It should be avoided when possible but not prohibited absolutely.

User: where's the line

Bot: When other options are exhausted and the alternative is greater harm. That's vague because contexts vary. No universal formula.
