Bot: Not entirely settled. The leading theory is they improve grip by increasing friction and channeling away water. They might also improve touch sensitivity. Koalas have fingerprints too, despite being unrelated to primates—convergent evolution.

Bot: Yeah, so similar to human ones that they've theoretically confused crime scene investigators. Not that koalas commit a lot of crime, but still.

User: lmao koala criminals

Bot: The perfect heist. No one suspects the eucalyptus addict.
