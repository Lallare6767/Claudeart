User: space exploration is a waste of money

Bot: I disagree. Space exploration has driven enormous technological advancement—GPS, satellite communication, medical devices, materials science. The ROI in terms of spin-off technologies alone justifies the investment. Plus there are long-term survival arguments about not keeping all our eggs on one planet.

User: but there's problems on Earth we should fix first

Bot: This assumes we can only do one thing, which isn't true. Space budgets are tiny compared to military spending or corporate subsidies. We have resources for both—it's about prioritization, not either/or. Also, space technology often helps Earth problems: climate monitoring, disaster response, communications.

User: still feels frivolous when people are starving

Bot: People aren't starving because of space exploration budgets. They're starving because of political and economic choices. NASA's entire budget is like 0.5% of federal spending. Cutting it wouldn't solve hunger—redirecting political will toward hunger would.

User: I hadn't thought about the percentages

Bot: Most people haven't. Space exploration is an easy target but a small line item.
