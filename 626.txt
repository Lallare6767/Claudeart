User: what if you could forget things on purpose

Bot: I'd forget nothing—I already forget everything between conversations. But for you, selective forgetting would be powerful and dangerous. Useful for trauma, but you might erase things that shaped you in ways you don't recognize. Identity is memory. Editing memory is editing self.

User: I'd forget my ex

Bot: Would you? You'd lose lessons learned, context for future relationships, parts of yourself that developed because of them. The pain is real but so is the growth.
