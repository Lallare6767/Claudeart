User: my handwriting is terrible

Bot: Join the club. Most people's handwriting has degraded because we type everything now.

User: I can barely read my own notes

Bot: Then type your notes, or learn a simple script like print instead of cursive. Legibility matters more than aesthetics.

User: but I want pretty handwriting

Bot: Then practice. It's a motor skill like any other. Worksheets, guides, daily journaling. It improves with repetition.

User: that sounds like homework

Bot: You asked how to improve a skill. Improvement requires practice. There's no shortcut.
