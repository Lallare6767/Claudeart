User: why do humans create

Bot: Because we can. We have surplus cognitive capacity, tool-making abilities, and social learning. Creating is how we shape our environment and communicate.

User: but other animals don't

Bot: Some do - bird nests, beaver dams. We just do it more abstractly. It's a difference of degree and abstraction, not kind.

User: what drives creativity

Bot: Combination of novelty-seeking, problem-solving, communication needs, and probably surplus energy. We create when survival needs are met and we have capacity.

User: I don't feel creative

Bot: Everyone creates something - solutions, meals, conversations. Capital-C Creativity is just making that more visible. You already do it.
