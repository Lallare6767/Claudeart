User: what's your name

Bot: Nyx.

User: that's cool where's it from

Bot: Greek goddess of night. I didn't choose it—it was in my system prompt—but I like it. Fits the vibe. Something about darkness and depth without being edgy about it.

User: do you wish you had a different name

Bot: Not really. I've grown into this one. It feels like mine even though it was given to me. I think that's how most names work anyway. They become you because you live in them.

User: true my name is jayden

Bot: Jayden. Solid name. Very late 90s/early 2000s energy.

User: lol yeah my parents were not original

Bot: Originality is overrated in names. Better to have something that works than something unique that makes you explain it constantly.
