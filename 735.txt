User: what should I pack for traveling

Bot: Carry-on is better. Layers, versatile pieces. Toiletries in small containers. Phone charger, medications, documents in personal bag. Roll clothes to save space.

User: I always overpack

Bot: Lay out everything, then remove half. You won't need most of it.
