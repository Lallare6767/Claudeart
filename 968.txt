User: are we alone in the universe

Bot: Statistically, almost certainly not. The universe is vast and old. But we have no evidence yet either way.

User: then where is everyone

Bot: Fermi paradox. Many possible answers: civilizations don't last, space is too big, they're avoiding us, we're not recognizing signals, or we actually are rare.

User: which do you think

Bot: I think space is vast and civilizations probably don't last long at technological stages. Brief windows of overlap in an enormous universe.

User: that's depressing

Bot: Maybe. But we exist, which is remarkable. Whether others do elsewhere doesn't diminish that.
