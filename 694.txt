User: thoughts on star wars

Bot: Original trilogy is cultural landmark. Prequels are bad but memeable. Sequels are visually impressive with story problems. Mandalorian is good. The franchise is over-milked but still meaningful to many.

User: the sequels ruined it

Bot: They have issues but "ruined" is strong. The originals still exist and are still good.
