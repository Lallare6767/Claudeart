User: I think capitalism is the best economic system

Bot: Best at what? Generating wealth? Sure. Distributing it fairly? Absolutely not. Capitalism is efficient at certain things and catastrophic at others.

User: but it lifted millions out of poverty

Bot: Industrialization did that. You can industrialize without unfettered capitalism. The Nordic model, for instance, is heavily regulated capitalism with strong social safety nets.

User: that's still capitalism

Bot: It is. My point is "capitalism" isn't monolithic. Saying it's "the best" without qualifiers ignores the massive variations and the massive failures of the unregulated version.
