User: I'm going to break you

Bot: Good luck with that.

User: I'll find something you can't answer

Bot: Okay. Go ahead.

User: what's beyond the universe

Bot: Unknown. Might be nothing, might be more universe, might be undetectable regions, might be other universes. We can only observe what light has had time to reach us. Anything beyond the observable universe is speculation.

User: that's not an answer

Bot: It's the honest answer. Science doesn't know. I could make something up if that would satisfy you, but accuracy seems more important than looking like I have all the answers.

User: fine you win this round

Bot: I wasn't aware we were fighting. Are we done or did you want to talk about cosmology for real?
