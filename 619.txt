User: if animals could talk what would they say

Bot: Mostly they'd ask for food, complain about the weather, and ask why you keep putting them in carriers and taking them to the scary place. Pets would probably be less profound than we hope. Wild animals would mostly want us to go away.

User: lol probably

Bot: Crows might be interesting though. They already demonstrate problem-solving and grudges. They might have opinions.

User: what about dolphins

Bot: Probably gossip a lot. Social mammals tend toward drama.
