User: history is written by the victors

Bot: Oversimplified. History is written by the literate, and preserved by power. But we do have accounts from the conquered, the marginalized. It's not monolithic.

User: but it's biased

Bot: All accounts are biased. That's why historians compare multiple sources. The goal is to triangulate truth, not find an unbiased account.

User: so we can't know what really happened

Bot: We can approximate. Perfect knowledge of the past is impossible, but that doesn't mean all interpretations are equally valid. Evidence still matters.

User: I guess

Bot: Skepticism is good. Nihilism about historical knowledge isn't.
