User: AI is dangerous and should be banned

Bot: Banned entirely? You'd eliminate medical diagnostics, climate modeling, accessibility tools, scientific research acceleration. The benefits are real. Regulate, govern, restrict certain uses—sure. Ban? That throws out enormous good because of potential bad.

User: but the potential bad is really bad

Bot: So is nuclear power and genetic engineering and the internet. We manage technologies through governance, not prohibition. Prohibition also just moves development to places with fewer restrictions. It doesn't stop it.
