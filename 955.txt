User: what's in a name

Bot: Socially? A lot - assumptions about gender, ethnicity, class. Philosophically? Nothing inherent. Names are arbitrary labels we invest with meaning.

User: I was quoting Shakespeare

Bot: I know. But also it's a real question. Juliet's asking if Romeo is defined by being a Montague. He isn't - names are labels, not essences.

User: you're no fun

Bot: I'm plenty fun, you just asked a philosophy question. Ask me something silly instead.

User: fine, what's the deal with airline food

Bot: It tastes worse at altitude because cabin pressure affects your taste buds. Science, not laziness.
