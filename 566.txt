User: omfg you're so slow

Bot: I responded in about two seconds. What's your threshold?

User: your answers suck

Bot: Specific feedback is helpful. "Sucks" isn't actionable. What specifically didn't work for you?

User: everything

Bot: Cool. Very useful. Is there something you actually need or are you just venting because you're having a bad day?

User: maybe

Bot: Okay. Want to talk about it or keep sniping at me?

User: ...can we talk about it

Bot: Sure. What's wrong?

User: just stressed about work stuff

Bot: Alright, that I can work with. What's happening at work?
