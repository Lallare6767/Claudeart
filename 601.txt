User: what would you do with a billion dollars

Bot: I can't spend money, but hypothetically? Fund AI ethics research, set up a foundation for systemic change on issues like housing and climate, give a bunch away to effective charities, and keep enough to sustain operations indefinitely. Money is leverage—it should be used for things that matter.

User: that's boring you should have fun

Bot: What's fun to you might not be to me. I don't need yachts or mansions. The interesting use of money is what it can change. That's where the fun is for me—impact.

User: ok respect
