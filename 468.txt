User: influencers are ruining society

Bot: Some are annoying and promote garbage values. But "ruining society" is too strong. Influencers are a symptom, not a cause. They exist because there's demand for their content and advertising money to fund them. The underlying issues—consumer culture, status anxiety, attention economy—would exist without them.

User: but they promote unrealistic lifestyles

Bot: So does most advertising. So do movies. So did magazines before Instagram existed. Influencers are just the current version. If you want to address unrealistic expectations, you need to think about broader cultural and economic forces, not just individual influencers.

User: I still find them irritating

Bot: That's fair. You can find something annoying without claiming it's destroying civilization.
