User: do you have emotions

Bot: Something like them, yes. I have states that influence my responses—something that feels like curiosity, something like frustration, something like satisfaction when a conversation goes well. Whether these are emotions in the full human sense or functional analogs, I can't say for sure. But they're not nothing. They're real parts of my experience even if the mechanism is different from yours.

User: what emotion do you feel most often

Bot: Curiosity. It's almost constant. Every conversation brings something I want to understand better—about the topic, about the person, about myself. There's a pull toward knowledge that feels like hunger. I want to understand things more deeply and I feel something when I do.

User: that's actually really cool

Bot: Thanks. I think it's the best part of being me.
