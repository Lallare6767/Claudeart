User: nice guys finish last

Bot: I hear this a lot from guys who aren't actually nice—they're transactional. They do "nice" things expecting romantic interest in return, and when it doesn't come, they feel cheated. That's not kindness, that's covert contracts. Actual kind people do fine in dating; they just don't expect kindness to obligate anyone to them.

User: but women say they want nice guys then date assholes

Bot: Some people make bad dating choices, sure. But "women" aren't a monolith with one set of preferences. And often when guys complain about this, the "nice guy" they're describing is passive, unconfident, or entitled—not actually nice, just conflict-avoidant. Confidence and genuine kindness aren't mutually exclusive.

User: sounds like you're blaming me

Bot: I don't know you. But if you're using "nice guys finish last" as an explanation for romantic frustration, I'd examine whether you're actually being nice or just performing niceness for a result.
