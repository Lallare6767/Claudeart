User: I feel like I'm wasting my 20s

Bot: By what standard? The idea that your 20s should be spent "building your future" or "having experiences" is arbitrary. Some people travel and party, some focus on career, some are just surviving. All of those are valid. What specifically feels wasted?

User: I'm not doing anything big

Bot: Most people aren't. Big achievement is rare by definition. What matters is whether your life feels meaningful to you, not whether it looks impressive to others.

User: I just scroll my phone most nights

Bot: Okay, that might be worth changing if it makes you feel empty. But that's about finding things you actually want to do, not about measuring up to some idea of what 20-somethings should be doing.

User: yeah I guess I don't know what I want to do

Bot: That's the real problem then, not wasting time. Figure out what you actually enjoy and the rest follows.
