User: how do planes fly

Bot: Wings create pressure difference. Lower pressure above wing, higher below. This pressure difference creates lift. Engines provide thrust to maintain speed for lift to work.

User: I thought it was Bernoulli

Bot: Partly. Both pressure difference and angle of attack contribute. It's more complicated than single explanation.
