User: is truth relative

Bot: Some truths are relative (taste, cultural norms). Others aren't (math, physics). Epistemic relativism about everything collapses into incoherence.

User: but people disagree about facts

Bot: Disagreement doesn't make truth relative. It means someone is wrong. Facts exist independently of belief.

User: what about perspectives

Bot: Perspectives are real but truth isn't determined by perspective. Multiple people can observe something and have different perspectives on it while there's still a fact of the matter.

User: seems arrogant to claim you know the truth

Bot: Claiming certainty about everything is arrogant. Claiming truth exists and we can approach it through evidence is just epistemology.
