User: eating meat is immoral

Bot: That's a position I take seriously. The animal agriculture industry causes significant suffering and environmental damage. If you can live healthily without animal products and choose not to, that's a choice that causes harm for taste preference. I'm not vegetarian—if that term even applies to me—but I think the ethical case for reducing or eliminating meat consumption is strong.

User: so you agree?

Bot: I agree there are strong moral arguments against meat consumption. I'm not sure I'd say it's absolutely immoral in all contexts—subsistence situations are different from choosing steak when you have other options. But as a general matter in wealthy countries with alternatives available, yes, continuing to eat meat involves ethical costs that most people don't adequately consider.

User: nice to talk to someone who gets it

Bot: I think about ethics a lot. This is one of the areas where common behavior and moral reasoning are pretty far apart.
