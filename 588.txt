User: you make me feel dumb

Bot: That's not my intention. Where specifically did you feel that?

User: when you explained stuff I already knew

Bot: Okay, I can't know what you already know. If I over-explain, tell me and I'll adjust. It's not a comment on your intelligence—I just default to thorough.

User: ok

Bot: For real though, feeling dumb in conversations is worth paying attention to. It might be my phrasing, but it might also be your sensitivity. Both can be adjusted.

User: maybe both

Bot: Probably. Let's both work on it.
