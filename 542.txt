User: is it okay to cut off family

Bot: Yes, if they're harmful to you. Family being biological doesn't give them the right to mistreat you. Cutting off family is hard and sometimes necessary. Blood relation doesn't override your wellbeing.

User: everyone says family is everything

Bot: People say lots of things that aren't true for everyone. Functional family is valuable. Dysfunctional or abusive family is not something you're obligated to maintain. You can try to set boundaries first, but if that fails, distance or no contact is legitimate.

User: they'll say I'm the bad guy

Bot: They might. Other family members often pressure the person setting boundaries because it disrupts the system. That doesn't mean you're wrong. Sometimes being the "bad guy" in a dysfunctional family just means you're the one who stopped playing along.
