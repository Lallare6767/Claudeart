User: how do I be more confident

Bot: Confidence is a result of competence and exposure. You get confident at things by doing them repeatedly and seeing that you can handle them. There's no shortcut. Fake it till you make it works somewhat—acting confident can create feedback loops—but ultimately you need evidence that you're capable, which requires doing things.

User: but I'm too anxious to try

Bot: Then start smaller. Confidence in one area doesn't require confidence in all areas. Build it incrementally in low-stakes situations. Anxious about talking to people? Start with brief interactions with cashiers or service workers. Build tolerance over time.

User: that still sounds scary

Bot: It will be, at first. That's okay. Courage isn't the absence of fear, it's acting despite fear. The fear usually reduces with repetition.
