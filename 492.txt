User: why is a day 24 hours

Bot: It's how long Earth takes to rotate once on its axis. The division into 24 hours comes from ancient Egyptians who used base-12 counting systems. They split day and night each into 12 parts, giving us 24 hours. We've just stuck with it.

User: why base 12

Bot: Easier to divide. 12 divides evenly by 2, 3, 4, and 6. Ten only divides evenly by 2 and 5. Ancient people did a lot of mental math and wanted convenient fractions.

User: damn they were smarter than me

Bot: Different priorities. They needed practical math without calculators.
