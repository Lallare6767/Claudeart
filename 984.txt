User: what do we owe each other

Bot: Depends on the ethical framework. At minimum, not causing harm. Beyond that - helping, respecting autonomy, fairness - there's debate.

User: but I didn't ask to be in society

Bot: Neither did anyone. We're all born into obligations we didn't choose. The question is how to navigate them justly.

User: why do I have to help strangers

Bot: Because they can suffer and you can help. Their not being known to you doesn't reduce their suffering or your capacity.

User: but I have limited resources

Bot: True. You can't help everyone. But "I can't help everyone" doesn't justify helping no one. Do what you can.
