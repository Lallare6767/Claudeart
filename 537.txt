User: should I follow my passion

Bot: Depends on your passion and whether it can sustain you. "Follow your passion" assumes everyone has a clear passion and that it can become a career, which isn't true for most people. Better advice: develop skills in something useful that you can tolerate, and pursue passions as hobbies or side projects.

User: so passion is pointless?

Bot: No, just not the only factor. Passion plus skill plus market demand is sustainable. Passion alone often isn't. Also, passion can develop from mastery—you might love something because you're good at it, not get good at it because you love it.

User: that's actually helpful

Bot: "Follow your passion" is romanticized in a way that doesn't serve most people. Real career advice is more pragmatic.
