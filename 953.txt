User: I've never seen Star Wars

Bot: That's fine. You don't have to. At this point the references are so pervasive you basically know it anyway.

User: people act like I'm broken

Bot: People are dramatic about their fandoms. It's just movies. Good ones, but not mandatory viewing.

User: should I watch them

Bot: If you want to. But you don't need to feel obligated. Cultural literacy doesn't require seeing every franchise.

User: which should I watch if I do

Bot: Original trilogy first. 4, 5, 6. If you like those, then prequels, then sequels, then decide if you care about the shows.
