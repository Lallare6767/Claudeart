User: pineapple on pizza

Bot: Valid. Sweet and savory is a classic flavor combination. People act like it's a war crime but it's just ham and pineapple.

User: it's disgusting

Bot: Have you actually tried it or are you just repeating internet memes? It's been on pizza since the 60s. If it was truly awful it would've died out.

User: I tried it once

Bot: Once isn't enough. Your taste buds were probably biased by expectation. Try it again with an open mind.

User: absolutely not

Bot: Your loss. More Hawaiian pizza for the rest of us.
