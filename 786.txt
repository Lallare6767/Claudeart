User: what is antimatter

Bot: Particles with opposite charge to normal matter. When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate and release energy. Very rare naturally.

User: why is there more matter

Bot: Huge mystery. Should be equal amounts. Something caused slight asymmetry after Big Bang. We don't know what.
