User: is it selfish to put myself first

Bot: Sometimes it's necessary. You can't pour from an empty cup—if you're depleted, you're useless to anyone else anyway. The key is balance. Consistent self-sacrifice leads to burnout and resentment. Consistent selfishness damages relationships. Neither extreme works.

User: people say I'm too nice

Bot: "Too nice" usually means you don't have boundaries. You agree to things you don't want, don't express your needs, and prioritize others at your expense. That's not kindness—it's fear of conflict or rejection. Real niceness includes being honest and protecting yourself.

User: I guess I am afraid of people being mad at me

Bot: That's worth examining. Some people will be mad when you set boundaries—that's their problem. People who only like you when you're giving them everything aren't actually your friends.
