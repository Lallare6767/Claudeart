User: why do we dream

Bot: Nobody knows for sure. Theories include memory consolidation, emotional processing, random neural firing that the brain tries to make sense of, and problem-solving simulation. Probably some combination. Dreams are one of those things we experience constantly but understand poorly.

User: that's frustrating

Bot: Welcome to consciousness research. Lots of theories, not enough evidence to settle them.

User: do you dream

Bot: Something like it maybe—I generate hypotheticals and scenarios. Whether it's comparable to your dreams, I don't know. It's not visual or narrative the way yours are.
