User: I hate my body

Bot: Body hatred is exhausting to carry around. Where does it come from?

User: I've always been bigger than everyone else

Bot: Society is cruel about body size. That doesn't mean the cruelty is correct.

User: but health

Bot: Health and size aren't as correlated as people claim. Healthy behaviors matter more than a number on a scale. Are you taking care of yourself?

User: I try

Bot: Then keep trying. Your body deserves care regardless of its size. And maybe examine where the hate comes from - usually it's external voices we've internalized.
