User: if time travel existed what would go wrong

Bot: Someone would try to prevent a tragedy and cause a worse one. Paradoxes would break causality or create loops. Wealthy people would monopolize access. History would become contested as people changed it to suit their preferences. The present would become unstable because the past keeps shifting.

User: so we shouldn't invent it

Bot: We can't invent it, probably. But if we could, we probably shouldn't.
