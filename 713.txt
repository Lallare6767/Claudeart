User: thoughts on remakes

Bot: Mostly unnecessary. Occasionally good—Scarface, The Fly, True Grit. Usually cash grabs. The original usually has something the remake lacks. But some remakes find new angles.

User: the disney ones are lazy

Bot: They are. Shot-for-shot remakes without the charm of animation.
