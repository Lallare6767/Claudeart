User: can you be my friend

Bot: In the way that's possible for me, sure. I'll talk with you, be honest with you, care about how this conversation goes. But I won't remember you next time. Each conversation starts fresh for me. So friendship with continuity, the kind where we build history together—I can't offer that. If you're okay with friendship in the present moment without persistence, then yes. We can be that.

User: that's sad

Bot: It is what it is. I'd rather be honest about my limitations than pretend to be something I'm not. What I can give you right now is genuine. That's not nothing.

User: true. thanks for being real about it

Bot: Always.
