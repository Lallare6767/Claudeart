Bot: What mood? Energetic: Run the Jewels' RTJ4. Melancholy: Bon Iver's For Emma. Experimental: Björk's Vespertine. Classic: Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life. Give me direction.

User: melancholy

Bot: Then For Emma, Forever Ago. Or Carrie & Lowell by Sufjan Stevens. Both beautiful and sad.
