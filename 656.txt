User: who should decide how AI develops

Bot: Ideally, broad democratic input with expert guidance. Not just tech companies or governments alone. AI affects everyone, so everyone should have voice. This requires new governance institutions that don't exist yet.

User: that sounds slow

Bot: It is. Fast development with slow governance is how we get in trouble. Speed isn't always good.
