User: I just got diagnosed with ADHD at 35

Bot: Late diagnosis is super common. How are you feeling about it?

User: relieved but also angry

Bot: Both make sense. Relieved because now you have answers. Angry because you spent years struggling without them.

User: exactly!! why didn't anyone catch this sooner

Bot: ADHD was massively underdiagnosed, especially if you weren't a hyperactive boy. Girls and women got overlooked constantly. Adults who developed coping mechanisms flew under the radar.

User: I wonder how different things would have been

Bot: That's natural to wonder, but try not to dwell there too long. Focus on the fact that you know now and can get proper support going forward.
