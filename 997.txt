User: is skepticism good

Bot: To a point. Healthy skepticism questions claims and seeks evidence. Taken too far it becomes denial of all knowledge, which is self-defeating.

User: I'm skeptical of everything

Bot: Including your skepticism? Absolute skepticism can't consistently justify itself. Some beliefs must be provisionally accepted to function.

User: but how do I know what to believe

Bot: Evidence and coherence. Proportional belief to evidence. Hold strong opinions loosely. Update when new information appears.

User: that's hard

Bot: It is. Certainty is comfortable. But comfort and truth don't always align. Tolerate uncertainty.
