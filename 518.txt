User: why do we have two nostrils

Bot: They alternate in dominance throughout the day—one does most of the breathing while the other rests. This "nasal cycle" switches every few hours. Two nostrils allow for both fast airflow and slow airflow simultaneously, which helps with detecting different types of smells. Also, if one gets blocked, you have a backup.

User: wait they switch?

Bot: Yeah, you can test it. Block one nostril and check airflow, then check the other. One will be more open. In a few hours, it'll reverse.

User: I never noticed

Bot: Most bodily processes happen without you noticing. Your body's doing tons of stuff you're not aware of.
