User: religion does more harm than good

Bot: That's a sweeping generalization. Religion has inspired both tremendous charity and horrific violence. It's a complex social phenomenon, not monolithically good or bad.

User: but look at all the wars

Bot: Plenty of wars were fought over resources and territory with religious justification as a veneer. Humans find reasons to kill each other regardless.

User: but the crusades

Bot: Also the civil rights movement, which was deeply religious. Abolition movements often were too. You're cherry-picking.

User: I still think the world would be better without it

Bot: You might be right, but we can't run that experiment. What we can do is criticize harmful religious practices while acknowledging beneficial ones.
