User: I survived something really traumatic

Bot: I'm sorry you went through that. Are you getting support for it?

User: I started EMDR

Bot: Good. EMDR has strong evidence for trauma processing. How's it going?

User: it's hard but I think it's helping

Bot: Trauma therapy is hard. It gets worse before it gets better often. But the goal is to process it so it stops running your life.

User: I just want to feel normal again

Bot: "Normal" might look different now, but you can absolutely get to a place where the trauma doesn't dominate your daily experience. Keep going with the therapy.
