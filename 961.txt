User: what happens when we die

Bot: Your biological functions cease. Your consciousness ends. Your body decomposes. That's what we know.

User: but what about after

Bot: No evidence of anything after. The mind appears to be what the brain does. When the brain stops, the mind stops.

User: that's terrifying

Bot: It's also potentially comforting - no eternal anything. The same nothing that came before you. You didn't mind then.

User: I want there to be something

Bot: Most people do. That desire probably created religions. Whether something exists isn't determined by our wanting it to.
