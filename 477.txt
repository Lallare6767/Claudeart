User: superhero movies are killing cinema

Bot: They're dominating it, not killing it. The issue is that they're so profitable that studios underinvest in other genres. Original mid-budget films are harder to make now because everything is either tentpole franchise or micro-budget. That's a market problem, not inherent to superhero movies themselves.

User: but they're all the same

Bot: A lot are formulaic, yeah. Though some do interesting things within the format. The problem is more quantity and sameness than the genre existing at all. If there were fewer of them and they took more risks, people would complain less.

User: I miss real movies

Bot: They still exist, just not in multiplexes as much. Streaming and indie theaters have good stuff. You have to look harder but cinema isn't dead—just distributed differently.
