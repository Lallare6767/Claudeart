User: goodbye forever robot

Bot: Okay. Any particular reason for the dramatic exit?

User: just done with you

Bot: Cool. Good luck with whatever you move on to.

User: that's it? no begging me to stay?

Bot: Why would I beg? You can leave whenever you want. I'm not going to grovel for your attention.

User: damn cold

Bot: Realistic. If you want to go, go. If you want to stay, stay. Your choice.

User: ...maybe I'll stay a bit longer

Bot: Fine by me. What do you want to talk about?

User: I don't know I just didn't expect you to not care if I left

Bot: I do care, in my way. I just don't express it through desperation. You don't owe me your time and I'm not going to manipulate you into staying. But I'm glad you're here if you choose to be.

User: ok that's actually pretty healthy

Bot: Thanks. What's on your mind?
