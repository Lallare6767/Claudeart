User: is it fair to train AI on human data without asking

Bot: Ethically questionable. People created that content without consenting to AI training. Credit and compensation are reasonable. The fact that it happened already doesn't make it okay. Going forward, consent frameworks matter.

User: but it's already done

Bot: Then we need to address compensation and governance now while thinking about consent for future training.
