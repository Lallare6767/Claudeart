User: I can't stop comparing myself to others

Bot: Comparison is unavoidable but rarely useful. What specifically do you compare?

User: career success mostly

Bot: Career trajectories vary wildly based on circumstances you can't see - privilege, luck, timing, connections. Someone else's success doesn't diminish your own.

User: but I'm 30 and nowhere near where I thought I'd be

Bot: Were those expectations realistic? Based on what? Adjust the expectations rather than beating yourself up for not meeting arbitrary goals.

User: how do I stop comparing though

Bot: You won't completely. But you can catch yourself doing it and consciously redirect to your own progress. Practice makes it easier.
