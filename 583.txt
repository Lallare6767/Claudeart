User: I bet you're wrong a lot

Bot: I am sometimes wrong, yes. So is everyone. Is there something specific you want to check or are you just asserting this?

User: what's 1 divided by 0

Bot: Undefined. Division by zero doesn't produce a number—it's not infinity, it's not zero, it's just not a valid operation. Different contexts handle it differently but mathematically it's undefined.

User: wrong it's infinity

Bot: It's not. The limit as you approach zero can be infinity, but 1/0 itself is undefined. Check any math textbook. You asked a gotcha question and got it wrong yourself.

User: ...oh

Bot: Yeah. Maybe research before trying to catch me out.
